## Project Overview

This is to be my second project since joining [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/) but the first
project that fully aligned with a product launch and was even featured on the
[product launch landing page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/whatsnew/).

This project was hard! and required my entire skill set. I came up with an idea and pitched the concept, designed the
whole application, built the front-end and developed a multi-region Node.js Lambda API and deployed it to AWS. Then
wrote about the poroject for the Cockroach Labs blog:
[The Art of Data Residency and Application Architecture](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/multi-region-serverless-data-residency/).

I didn't do this alone though. [Rob Reid](https://twitter.com/robreid_io) helped with the CockroachDB config and with
fleshing out the idea to test it was technically possible. Thanks Rob, it was great working with you!

### Problem

I wrote about this before on The New Stack:
[The Distance from Data to You in Edge Computing](https://thenewstack.io/the-distance-from-data-to-you-in-edge-computing/)
but the _short(er)_ version is as follows:

When an end user logs in, or uses an application to perform a task, the data has to be requested or posted to and from a
database.

The distance the data travels contributes to the time it takes for the transfer. The greater the distance, the longer
the end user will likely see a "loading" state. But wait, there's more...

<GatsbyImage alt="Single region diagram" image={props.embedded.image2} />

When end users request or posts data, they're not directly interacting with the database (because it's not secure),
these requests are instead, routed via a server (which is secure). The location of the server in relation to the
database and the end user all contributes to the total distance traveled. Get this architecture right and you've got a
very snappy application, get this wrong and, well, end users won't like it.

### Solution

The solution is to shorten the distance between end user, server and database. Or to put it another way. Multi-region
applicaton architecture.

In this launch campaign CockroachDB
[released multi-region serverless](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-23-1-release/) and, (if you know what
you're doing), is super simple to setup (~10 seconds) and just as easy to configure (~10 minutes) but unfortunately, as
I mentioned above, the database is only **one** part of a **two** part puzzle. To create a truly multi-region
application, developers need to configure multi-region servers, this is nowhere near as easy.

### Insight

When I met with our Sales Engineers it became clear that many customers hadn't considered the requirement to deploy
their servers to multiple regions. It was also mentioned that the broader concept of a multi-region database wasn't
completely understood.

## The Idea

To demonstrate how both a multi-region server and database setup can work together I had to build the real thing. There
are a few concepts that are demonstrated in this app.

The first requirement was a general awareness of multi-region serverless. To achieve this I wanted to build an
application where users could interact and create something. The hope being they share and thus help spread the word. I
chose Art. Using the [Silo](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/demos/demo-data-residency/) application users can create and
save their own unique artwork to share... but there's a catch.

<GatsbyImage alt="Multi-region diagram" image={props.embedded.image4} />

The second requirement was to explain the importance of correctly pairing the server and database architecture and
describe the general approach using AWS.

The third requirement was to demonstrate one of the benefits of a multi-region setup. We chose to focus on Data
Residency. This configuration, or topology refers to a method by which data can be pinned to any one of the regions
where the database has been deployed. This has two main benefits. The data is stored closer to the server and the user,
resulting in faster data transfer and it can also be used to domicile data.

... and here's the catch. when users create artwork using the app, artwork created using US imagery and colors from the
US flag are saved in the US. Artwork that is created using EU imagery and colors from European flags is saved in Europe.
Users of [Silo](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/demos/demo-data-residency/) can see both when they're creating the artwork
but when they [preview](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/demos/demo-data-residency/preview/1465706/) their artwork or visit
the [gallery](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/demos/demo-data-residency/gallery/) they'll only see data that has been
stored in their "local" region. This is what I've been reffering to as:

## Video Walk through

Here's a short video by [Rob Reid](https://twitter.com/robreid_io) that explains a little more about how the app works,
and how we route requests via an AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone.

## Blog

Or, if you'd prefer, here's a full write up about the project, it's quite long, but worth it.
