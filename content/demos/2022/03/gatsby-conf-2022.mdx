## Project Overview

From December 2021 to Feb 2022 I built [GatsbyConf 2022](https://gatsbyconf.com/).

This site was the main conference site and was used to drive awareness for the event, capture registrants, detail the
running order for both days along with individual pages for each of the conference speakers. The site is built using
Gatsby 4 with sourced from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) using
[gatsby-source-contentful](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-contentful/).

The site features a lazy-loaded three.js hero animation combined with hybrid SVG "number people" created by the
wonderful [Miss Chatz](https://miss-chatz.com/gatsby-power-in-numbers).

I blogged about my journey building this site and wrote an additional blog post about performance and three.js.
