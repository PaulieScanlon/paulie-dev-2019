## Project Overview

In the summer of 2021 I created [500 Bottles](https://500bottles.gatsbyjs.io/). I designed the logo and the bottle, and
worked with Marketing to create limited edition swag, along with designing and building the site.

This site is an example of what can be achieved using
[gatsby-source-shopify](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-shopify/), Gatsby's Headless e-commerce solution.
How it differs from a other e-commerce demos that display lots of products on a page is, by displaying 0 products on a
page.

## Deliverables

What the site does do however is source the one and only product in the store that was marked to be part of a free swag
giveaway, and invites users to spin to win.

Users entered their details, and upon successful submission, via the use of a Gatsby
[Serverless Function](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/functions), the bottle began to spin. There was a 1-in -5
chance the wheel would land on win.

If the bottle landed on win I programmatically created a Shopify checkout and unique, one-time-use discount code using
the Shopify Buy API, and then directed users over to a secure Shopify page to complete the checkout process.

Once a checkout was completed I call the Gatsby Cloud Webhook which rebuilds the site and decreases the available stock
inventory by 1. An new Open-graph image was also created which displayed the current stock level when shared on social
media.

The campaign ran for 14 days until all 500 limited edition bottles had been claimed.

### Bonus Deliverable

Shopify captures lots of information about users, so I thought I'd surface some of it. At build time, and securely on
the server I used the Shopify Admin API to get geo-graphical shipping information to display on a three.js interactive
globe. This allowed anyone visiting the site to see where in the world the winners were. I wrote article for
[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/gatsby-serverless-functions-international-space-station/)
which explains how I achieved this.
