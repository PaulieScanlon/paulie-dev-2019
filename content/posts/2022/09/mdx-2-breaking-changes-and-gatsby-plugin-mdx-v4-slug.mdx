If you're upgrading to **v4** of
[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/?=gatsby-plugin-mdx) you'll likely run into
errors. Both **MDX 2** and **v4** of the plugin are major releases and inline with
[semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) guidelines, breaking changes are to be expected.

Both Gatsby and MDX have documented the changes and you can find more information about the changes on the following
links.

- [MDX: Migrating from v1 to v2](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/)
- [Gatsby: v3 to v4: Breaking Changes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/?=gatsby-plugin-mdx#v3-to-v4-breaking-changes)

## Breaking Changes to Slug

In this post I'll only be covering the changes to the `slug` field. This change may only be relevant if you're using
`mdx.slug` to form routes using either
[createPage](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createPages) or
[collection routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/#collection-routes) with
[File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/).

## The Error

```shell
ERROR #85923  GRAPHQL

There was an error in your GraphQL query:

Cannot query field "slug" on type "Mdx".

If you don't expect "slug" to exist on the type "Mdx" it is most likely a typo. However, if you expect "slug" to exist there are a
couple of solutions to common problems:
```

This happens because `mdx.slug` has been removed from
[v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/?=gatsby-plugin-mdx#v3-to-v4-breaking-changes) of the plugin.

## Adding a slug field

If you'd like to keep using a `slug` with MDX 2 and v4 of the plugin it's necessary to create the `slug` field yourself.
One way you can achieve this is using
[onCreateNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#onCreateNode),
[createNodeField](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createNodeField) and the
[createFilePath Helper Function](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=gatsby-source#helper-functions)
from [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem).

This approach relies on local file names broadly conforming to [Semantic URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL)
/ [Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL) guidelines.

For example:

```
|-- src
    |-- pages
        |-- ✅ this-is-fine.mdx
        |-- ⚠️ this-/-could-/-be-/-problematic.mdx

```

In any case, if you've named your local `.mdx` files sensibly you should be able to use them to form a `slug`.

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
const { createFilePath } = require('gatsby-source-filesystem');

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, getNode, actions: { createNodeField } }) => {
  if (node.internal.type === 'Mdx') {
    createNodeField({
      node,
      name: 'slug',
      value: createFilePath({ node, getNode })
    });
  }
 ;

```

### createPages

You can then use this new field in `createPages` like this.

```diff
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions: { createPage, createRedirect } }) => {
  const {
    data: { allMdx }
  } = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        nodes {
          id
+         fields {
+           slug
+         }
-         slug
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  allMdx.nodes.forEach((node) => {
    const {
      id,
+     fields: { slug },
-     slug
    } = node;

    createPage({
      path: slug,
      ...
    });
  });
};
```

### File System Route API

And if you're creating pages using collection routes you can use the new field like this.

```diff
|-- src
    |-- pages
-        {mdx.slug}.js
+        {mdx.fields__slug}.js

```

## Querying fields.slug

In any GraphQL queries where you might have been using `mdx.slug`, perhaps when creating a navigation using a
[useStaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/graphql-api/#usestaticquery) hook, they will
now becomes the following.

```diff
// src/components/navigation.js

  const {
    allMdx: { nodes }
  } = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    {
      allMdx {
        nodes {
+         fields {
+           slug
+         }
-         slug
          frontmatter {
            title
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);
```

It's a small thing but having upgraded a few sites now I feel like this is the least manual way to work round the
missing `mdx.slug` field.
