Hello. It's been a little while, and I have a new job! I'm now at [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) and
in the coming months I'll be responsible for creating snazzy looking demo sites and documentation that'll help you get
the most out of [CockroachDB](https://twitter.com/CockroachDB/). I'll most likely be using one of the modern JavaScript
frameworks to create these demos, E.g: [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hope to be focussed on
[CockroachDB's Serverless offerings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/lp/serverless/).

But, before I got going, I needed to do a little bit of "Developer Admin".

## Newsletter Signups with Marketo and React

In each of the demo sites I'll be creating I'll want to include a Newsletter signup. This is good for a few reasons, but
mainly, I don't want you to miss out on the good stuff!

I've prepared a small demo site to help explain my requirements and have open-sourced the code if you'd like to take a
look.

- üöÄ Demo:
  [https://cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react.vercel.app/](https://cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react.vercel.app/)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Repo:
  [https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react)

There is however a problem. At [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) we use
[Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) for data capture and lead management, and Marketo forms aren't the easiest to work
with. Marketo typically requires you load scripts that inject styled forms directly into the
[DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model), and as you may already know, directly mutating the DOM when
using React is an anti-pattern, not to mention then needing to _"hack"_ styles over the top of the injected styles to
ensure your forms look and feel like part of the surrounding site.

In this post I'd like to explain one way I've implemented Marketo and you'll see from the demo site that the forms, as
promised, are styled the way I want them.

## Does Marketo Have an API?

You might be wondering if Marketo has an API, and if so, why not use that to create custom styled forms that can post
the form data to the right place?

The reason is actually quite unfathomable.
[Marketo does have an API](https://developers.marketo.com/javascript-api/forms/) but to use it, a `<script />` element
needs to be added to the page which loads some JavaScript, which then injects a styled HTML `<form />` element into the
page and adds the `MktoForms2` to the `window` object. This can then act as an API ü•¥.

Once the script has loaded and `MktoForms2` is available on the `window` you can use something similar to the example
below to submit your data:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (event, email) => {
  event.preventDefault()

  window.MktoForms2.getForm(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ID)
    .vals({ Email: email })
    .onSuccess(() => {
      ...
    })
    .submit()
}
```

However, loading this script is where things can get a little tricky. My solution is to create a React hook that handles
adding the Marketo script to the page, and removes all default styling from the Marketo form.

My solution involves three key ingredients, they are:

- A hidden Marketo form with all styles removed.
- A React hook that loads the script into the page.
- A real form that end users will see and use.

## Marketo Form Explained

This component returns an HTML `<form />` with an `id` of `"mktoForm"` + the `formId`. The HTML `<form />` element needs
an `id` for when the Marketo script has been loaded, the script uses this to inject the default styled form elements;
input(s), label(s), button etc.

### Finished Marketo Form

```javascript
import React, { memo } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

import useMarketo from '../hooks/use-marketo';

const MarketoForm = memo(({ debug, formId }) => {
  useMarketo({
    formId: formId,
    callback: () => {}
  });

  return <form id={`mktoForm_${formId}`} className={debug ? 'block' : 'hidden'} aria-hidden="true" />;
});

MarketoForm.defaultProps = {
  debug: false
};

MarketoForm.propTypes = {
  /** Show the real Marketo form */
  debug: PropTypes.bool,
  /** The Marketo Form Id */
  formId: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default MarketoForm;
```

The `<form />` element is set to `display: none` / (hidden) but I have added a `debug` prop in case you want to see what
it actually looks like. This component uses a React hook which I've named `useMarketo` to load the script and I'll
explain how that works next.

## React Hook Explained

I took inspiration from [Charlie Dieter's](https://github.com/charliedieter) wonderful example:
[react-marketo-hook](https://github.com/charliedieter/react-marketo-hook), but made a few changes to help with front-end
performance. You can find the `src` for my version of the hook here:
[hooks/use-marketo.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react/blob/main/hooks/use-marketo.js).

One of the changes I made uses the `whenRendered` callback which I've used to search the DOM and remove any attributes
or HTML elements that are not required.

Another change was made because I encountered a [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
warning pertaining to duplicate element ids. This happened because Marketo adds ids to the form elements. For example
the Email field is automatically assigned an `id` of `"Email"`. Normally this would be fine, but because I have two
forms on the page and both contain a field named Email, both end up with an id of `"Email"`. And as I'm sure you know,
ids need to be unique!

After the form has rendered I search the DOM for all form elements and change their ids so they include the `formId`. I
used a similar approach for the `for` attribute on the label elements.

For example the Email `for` and `id` attributes have been changed from `"Email"` to `"Email_1478"`.

```html
<label for="Email_1478" id="LblEmail_1478" class="mktoLabel mktoHasWidth">
  <div class="mktoAsterix">*</div>
  Email:
</label>
```

```html
<input
  id="Email_1478"
  name="Email"
  maxlength="255"
  aria-labelledby="LblEmail InstructEmail"
  type="email"
  class="mktoField mktoEmailField mktoHasWidth"
/>
```

### Finished useMarketo hook

... and here's the finished hook!

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useMarketo = ({ formId, callback }) => {
  const [scriptAdded, setScriptAdded] = useState(false);
  const [formLoaded, setFormLoaded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (scriptAdded) {
      if (!formLoaded) {
        MktoForms2.loadForm(
          `//${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}`,
          process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MUNCHKIN_ID,
          formId,
          callback
        );
        MktoForms2.whenRendered((form) => {
          const formElement = form.getFormElem()[0];
          const formElementId = form.getFormElem()[0].id.split('_')[1];

          /** Remove the style attribute and make for, and id attributes unique */
          Array.from(formElement.querySelectorAll('[style]'))
            .concat(formElement)
            .forEach((element) => {
              element.removeAttribute('style');
              if (element.hasAttribute('id') && element.tagName !== 'FORM') {
                element.setAttribute('id', `${element.getAttribute('id')}_${formElementId}`);
              }

              if (element.tagName === 'LABEL') {
                element.setAttribute('for', `${element.getAttribute('for')}_${formElementId}`);
              }
            });

          /** Remove <span /> from DOM */
          Array.from(formElement.querySelectorAll('.mktoInstruction')).forEach((element) => {
            element.remove();
          });

          /** Remove <style /> from DOM */
          Array.from(formElement.children).forEach((element) => {
            if (element.type && element.type === 'text/css') {
              element.remove();
            }
          });
        });
        setFormLoaded(true);
      }
    } else {
      if (window.MktoForms2) {
        setScriptAdded(true);
      } else {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.defer = true;
        script.onload = () => (window?.MktoForms2 ? setScriptAdded(true) : null);
        script.src = `//${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/js/forms2/js/forms2.min.js`;
        document.head.appendChild(script);
      }
    }
  }, [scriptAdded]);
};

export default useMarketo;
```

## Real Form Explained

In the repo you'll see
[components/newsletter-form.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react/blob/main/components/newsletter-form.js),
and here's how to use it.

```javascript
<NewsletterForm formId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ID} />
```

This component, among other things contains the following:

- An instance of the hidden
  [components/marketo-form.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react/blob/main/components/marketo-form.js).
- Standard HTML `<form />`, `<label />` and `<input />` elements which you can style however you like!
- A `handleSubmit` function that submits data using `window.MktoForms2.getForm`.
- An instance of another hook called
  [hooks/use-reducer.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-custom-marketo-forms-with-react/blob/main/hooks/use-reducer.js)
  which handles loading states.

### Finished Real Form

... and here's the finished form!

```javascript
import React, { useState, useReducer, Fragment } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

import { initialState, reducer } from '../hooks/use-reducer';

import MarketoForm from './marketo-form';

const NewsletterForm = ({ formId }) => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    dispatch({
      type: 'isSubmitting'
    });

    window.MktoForms2.getForm(formId)
      .vals({ Email: email })
      .onSuccess(() => {
        dispatch({
          type: 'success'
        });
        setEmail('');
        return false;
      })
      .submit();
  };

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h3 className="m-0">Newsletter Form</h3>
      <p>Example form used to capture email addresses only.</p>
      <div className="bg-white rounded border border-brand-gray-b p-8 sm:px-16 pt-16">

        <small className="block mb-8 text-brand-gray">* Required fields</small>
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="form">
          <label className="form--label">
            <span className="form--label-text">
              Email<span className="form--label-required">*</span>
            </span>
            <input
              className="form--input"
              type="email"
              required
              placeholder="you@example.xyz"
              value={email}
              onChange={(e) => {
                setEmail(e.target.value);
              }}
            />
          </label>
          <span className="form--announce-container">
            {state.isSubmitting ? <span className="text-brand-orange">Submitting...</span> : null}
            {state.success ? <span className="form--announce-success">Thanks for signing up.</span> : null}
          </span>
          <button type="submit" className="transition-all form--button-submit" disabled={state.isSubmitting}>
            {state.isSubmitting ? 'Please wait...' : 'Subscribe'}
          </button>
        </form>
        <small className="preferences--cta">
          To update your email preferences visit{' '}
          <a
            href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/email-preferences/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            className="text-brand-deep-purple hover:!text-brand-primary"
          >

          </a>
        </small>
        <MarketoForm debug={false} formId={formId} />
      </div>
    </Fragment>
  );
};

NewsletterForm.propTypes = {
  /** The Marketo Form Id */
  formId: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default NewsletterForm;
