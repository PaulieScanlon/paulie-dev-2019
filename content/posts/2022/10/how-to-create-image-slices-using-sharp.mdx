Hey there, ok, this is a failed experiment, but it's October, Halloween is on the way and my experiment into image
slicing produced a pretty spooky result!

## Failed Experiment

I was planning on using the method described in this post to create a "hero image" for use in a demo site about Gatsby's
upcoming [Slice API](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36339), but the result was too harrowing and feels
like it's better suited as a title frame for a Netflix documentary about serial killers.

What do you think?

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image1} alt="Slice Hero Image" />

It is however quite an interesting use of [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/), and rather than waste my efforts I
thought I'd write about how I created the effect.

## Sharp

For those who don't know, [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) is what powers some of the image manipulation
techniques used by [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/). Sharp was created by
[Lovell Fuller](https://twitter.com/lovell), who, weirdly, interviewed me once for a short contract at
[LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton](https://www.lvmh.com/).

I never worked with Lovell as he was on PTO during my contract, but some years later I met him at Gatsby Days London,
2019 ‚Äî¬†Lovely stuff!

Anyway...

Here's a Live Preview and Repository of the output.

## Slice

If you inspect the DOM in the [Live Preview](https://sharp-image-manipulation.netlify.app/) you'll see the page is
displaying x60 separate images one after the other, which together, form that terrifying human face. Here are the steps
I took to create each of the slices.

## Source Images

I started by searching Unsplash using the key words "people faces" and added the search filter "black and white", and
then slowly downloaded and resized each of the images so the eyes and mouths were in approximately the same positions
within my .psd (PhotoShop document). I added some guides (opaque red ovals) to help with the alignment. I should have
known at this point the result was gonna be wild!

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image2} alt="Photoshop screenshot with guides" />

I then used PhotoShop's "Export > Layers to Files" which as you might imagine, exports each layer to a file. The output
can be seen in the repository here:
[sharp-image-manipulation/images/](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/sharp-image-manipulation/tree/main/images)

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image3} alt="Photoshop export layers to files" />

With all the source images exported I could now read the directory, slice each image, and output the slice into a new
directory. You can see the output of the slices in the repository here:
[sharp-image-manipulation/slices/](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/sharp-image-manipulation/tree/main/slices).

## Slice Function

In this next bit I'll explain how I used a combination of node, to read the source directory and iterate over each
image, and Sharp to `extract` a slice from each image and save it in the slices directory.

### Dependencies

The only dependency required is `sharp`.

```shell
npm install sharp
```

To run this function type the following in your terminal

```shell
node run
```

### Initial setup

```javascript
// run.js

const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');
const sharp = require('sharp');

const readDir = util.promisify(fs.readdir);
const makeDir = util.promisify(fs.mkdir);

const inputPath = './images';
const outputPath = './slices';

const run = async () => {
  if (fs.existsSync(outputPath)) {
    fs.rmSync(outputPath, { recursive: true });
    await makeDir(outputPath);
  } else {
    await makeDir(outputPath);
  }
};

run();
```

- The `run` function is asynchronous and initially checks if the `outputPath` exists, if it does, it removes the
  directory and anything contained within it, it then creates a new empty directory.

### Create Slices

This part of the function reads the `inputPath` / source directory, iterates over each image and creates a slice.

```diff

const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');
const sharp = require('sharp');

const readDir = util.promisify(fs.readdir);
const makeDir = util.promisify(fs.mkdir);

const inputPath = './images';
const outputPath = './slices';

const run = async () => {
  if (fs.existsSync(outputPath)) {
    fs.rmSync(outputPath, { recursive: true });
    await makeDir(outputPath);
  } else {
    await makeDir(outputPath);
  }

+  const images = await readDir(inputPath);
+  const sliceHeight = Math.floor(1280 / images.length);

+  images.forEach(async (file, index) => {
+    try {
+      const top = sliceHeight * index;
+      const input = `${inputPath}/${file}`;
+      const output = `${outputPath}/${index}.jpg`;
+
+      await sharp(input).extract({ width: 1920, height: sliceHeight, left: 0, top: top }).toFile(output);
+    } catch (error) {
+      console.error(error);
+    }
+  });
};

run();
```

- `images`: This const will be an array of the images contained within the `inputPath` directory
- `sliceHeight`: The `sliceHeight` is calculated by using the source image height of ` 1280px` and dividing it by the
  amount of images. In the case of this experiment there are 60 images, so the height of each slice will be approx
  `21px`.

  - `1280 / 60 = 21`

To create a slice using Sharp I used [extract](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize#extract) with a dynamically
created `top` position.

```javascript
const top = sliceHeight * index;
```

The `top` position increases on each iteration of the `forEach` by multiplying the `sliceHeight` value by the value of
the `index`.

- The `top` position for the first image would be: `21 x 0 = 0`.
- The `top` position for the second image would be: `21 * 1 = 21`,
- The `top` position for the third image would be: `21 * 2 = 42`, and so on.

The `top` position is used as a value within `.extract()`.

```javascript
.extract({ width: 1920, height: sliceHeight, left: 0, top: top });
```

I also use the `index` value to create the "slice" file name.

```javascript
const output = `${outputPath}/${index}.jpg`;
```

This is passed to `.toFile()` which creates the actual image "slice" file.

```javascript
.toFile(output)
```

You can see the `src` for the `run` function in the repository here:
[sharp-image-manipulation/run.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/sharp-image-manipulation/blob/main/run.js)

## The result

The result of the `run` function should be x60 images named `0 - 59.jpg`.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image4} alt="VS Code slices" />

These are then displayed in the HTML page in individual `<img />` elements. Some additional styling has been added to
"stack" the images one on top of the other.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image5} alt="HTML img elements" />

There's probably some extra stuff I could do to merge all of the slices back together and create a single image, but
that's an experiment for another day.

There's a ton of other stuff Sharp can do, for instance you might like to play around with color manipulation to add a
tint to each of the slices. Here's the [Color manipulation API](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-colour) from the
docs.

As it stands I don't have a need for this, but it's nice to tinker with stuff and I hope you now have a better
understanding of Sharp and perhaps even some of the leg work Gatsby does under the hood when optimizing images
automatically for you.
