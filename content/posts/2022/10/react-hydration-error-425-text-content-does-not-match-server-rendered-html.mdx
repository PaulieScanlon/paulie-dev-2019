If you're upgrading to React 18 and have run into the following error, this post should help explain what causes the
error, and a couple of solutions.

```shell
Text content does not match server-rendered HTML
```

If you'd like to code along at home I've prepared a small reproduction repo with a branch for each solution.

I recently ran into this issue myself when building this [demo](https://gatsbysharedfunctions.gatsbyjs.io/) for the
following blog post:
[How to use Serverless Functions with SSR](/posts/2022/09/how-to-use-serverless-fucntions-with-ssr/).

The reason was because I was using JavaScript's `Date()` constructor in a few components to render a date.

The solutions discussed in this post will mainly focus on dates, but this error could occur in many different
client/server scenarios.

## The Problem

In my case the error occurred when using dates because of a mismatch with the date, or more specifically the time, (in
seconds).

When Gatsby/React first renders a page on the server and the `Date()` constructor is used, the date output includes
seconds. Then, shortly after the initial page load, hydration occurs. During this period the elapsed time has changed,
therefore the seconds are different. This leads React to believe the "text" is different between server and client
renders, and to be fair to React, it is.

The solutions I'll be discussing will help rid you of the error by waiting for hydration to occur before attempting to
initialize the date constructor, but all will present you with a new problem.

## The New Problem

If you wait for hydration to occur before calling `new Date()` you'll first display the page with an empty HTML element.
This can affect Lighthouse [CLS scores](https://web.dev/cls/#what-is-a-good-cls-score). In most cases this can be
overcome by adding CSS to ensure the width or height of the HTML element doesn't change. However, it will still leave
you, initially with an empty element that "pings" into view after hydration.

## Solutions

As mentioned all of the following "solutions" will only prevent React from surfacing the error, but extra CSS solutions
will be required to overcome the new problems these solutions create. There are also a couple of things to consider
before implementing any of the solutions. I've done my best to explain them but feel free to comment if I'm mistaken or
anything is unclear.

### Suspense

This approach uses React's built in `Suspense` method. Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering.

#### Page

```javascript
// src/pages/index.js

import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Page</h1>
      <time>
        <Suspense fallback={null}>{new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</Suspense>
      </time>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

### Hydration Safe Hook

This approach comes with a warning. The result of a hook will cause a page to re-render this could lead to performance
issues because React will render the page once on initial hydration, and then again as a result of the hook. This will
happen for every "page" where the hook is implemented.

#### Page

```javascript
// src/pages/index.js

import React from 'react';

import { useHydrationSafeDate } from '../hooks/use-hydration-safe-date';

const Page = () => {
  const date = useHydrationSafeDate(new Date());

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Page</h1>
      <time>{date}</time>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

#### Hook

```javascript
// src/hooks/use-hydration-safe-date.js

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export const useHydrationSafeDate = (date) => {
  const [safeDate, setSafeDate] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    setSafeDate(new Date(date).toLocaleDateString());
  }, [date]);

  return safeDate;
};
```

### Hydration Provider

This approach is a little more involved as it requires the use of React's Context API. However, wrapping your site in a
Context Provider will mean the re-render after hydration will only happen once, unlike the Hydration Safe Hook approach
mentioned above.

_The following demonstrates how to wrap a site with a "Provider" using Gatsby specific methods._

#### App Context

```javascript
// src/context/app-context.js

import React, { createContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export const AppContext = createContext();

export const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [isHydrated, setIsHydrated] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsHydrated(true);
  }, []);

  return <AppContext.Provider value={{ hydrated: isHydrated }}>{children}</AppContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### Page

```javascript
// src/pages/index.js

import React from 'react';
import { AppContext } from '../context/app-context';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Page</h1>
      <time>
        <AppContext.Consumer>
          {({ hydrated }) => {
            return hydrated ? new Date().toLocaleDateString() : '';
          }}
        </AppContext.Consumer>
      </time>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

#### RootElement

```javascript
// src/components/root-element.js

import React from 'react';
import { AppProvider } from '../context/app-context';

const RootElement = ({ children }) => {
  return <AppProvider>{children}</AppProvider>;
};

export default RootElement;
```

#### gatsby-browser.js

```javascript
// ./gatsby-browser.js

import React from 'react';
import RootElement from './src/components/root-element';

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
  return <RootElement>{element}</RootElement>;
};
```

#### gatsby-ssr.js

```javascript
// ./gatsby-ssr.js

import React from 'react';
import RootElement from './src/components/root-element';

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
  return <RootElement>{element}</RootElement>;
};
```
