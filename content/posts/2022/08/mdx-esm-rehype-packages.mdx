Hey, in this post i'm going to show you how to use the latest ESM [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs) packages with
`gatsby-plugin-mdx` **v3**.

## Titus Wormer

Before we get started i'd like to introduce Titus ([@wooorm](https://twitter.com/wooorm)).

Titus is not only an absolute genius, he's a jolly nice chap too. He's helped me out more times than I can count. He's
been hugely involved in the upgrading of a number of popular [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs) and
[rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs) packages. Two of which i'll be discussing in this post.

## rehype-slug

> This plugin is useful when you have relatively long documents and you want to be able to link to particular sections.

- GitHub: [https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug)
- npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-slug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-slug)

## rehype-autolink-headings

> This plugin is useful when you have relatively long documents, where you want users to be able to link to particular
> sections, and you already have id attributes set on all (or certain?) headings.

- GitHub: [https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings)
- npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-autolink-headings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-autolink-headings)

The above two packages are quite commonly used in Gatsby sites to enable "click-able" headings. or "jumplinks" in blog
posts either written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). In this
post i'll be talking about how to use them with MDX, but the steps are similar for markdown.

## Common Installation

The most common way to use these packages with v3 of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` is as follows.

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
      options: {
        rehypePlugins: [require('rehype-slug'), [require('rehype-autolink-headings'), { behavior: 'wrap' }]]
      }
    },
  ]
};
```

### Versions and Errors

_The above approach will work when using the following package versions._

```json
// package.json

"gatsby-plugin-mdx": "3.19.0"
"rehype-slug":"4.0.0"
"rehype-autolink-headings":"4.0.0"

```

After this point both the `rehype-slug` and `rehype-autolink-headings` packages were upgraded to ESM only. If you
attempt to use versions beyond `4.0.0`, you'll likely see the following error when you start up your Gatsby development
server.

```
Error: [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module
```

You'll be able to see the changes in both packages if you comb over the commit messages and look for `5.0.0`

- [rehype-autolink-headings | Nov 11, 2020](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings/commits/main)

## Using ESM only

Currently `gatsby-config.js` doesn't support ESM module syntax out of the box, (although, the team are working on it
[Support ESM usage with Gatsby #31599](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/31599)), but there is a way to use
ESM modules with Gatsby.

Here's how ðŸ‘‡.

### Upgrade rehype Packages

Upgrade both of the rehype packages to at least `5.0.0`, but depending on when you're reading `@latest` might be a
better option.

```diff
// package.json

"gatsby-plugin-mdx": "3.19.0"
- "rehype-slug":"4.0.0"
- "rehype-autolink-headings":"4.0.0"
+ "rehype-slug":"5.0.0"
+ "rehype-autolink-headings":"5.0.0"

```

### wrapESMPlugin

Add the following "helper function" to `gatsby-config.js`. I lifted this from the Gatsby Docs but, **be aware**
[this is a link to the new v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/?=mdx#gatsby-remark--plugins) version
of `gatsby-plugin-mdx`.

_I will be writing about the new v4 plugin at some point so stay tuned, or follow me on Twitter for updates:
[@PaulieScanlon](https://twitter.com/PaulieScanlon)_

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js

const wrapESMPlugin = (name) =>
  function wrapESM(opts) {
    return async (...args) => {
      const mod = await import(name);
      const plugin = mod.default(opts);
      return plugin(...args);
    };
  };
```

Now, instead of using `require`, you can use `wrapESMPlugin`. Here's the diff.

```diff
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
      options: {
- rehypePlugins: [require('rehype-slug'), [require('rehype-autolink-headings'), { behavior: 'wrap' }]]
+ rehypePlugins: [wrapESMPlugin('rehype-slug'), [wrapESMPlugin('rehype-autolink-headings'), { behavior: 'wrap' }]]
      }
    },
  ]
};
```

That should just about wrap things up. I know that this method **won't work for all** rehype or remark ESM packages, so
if you have attempted to use this approach unsuccessfully, please do drop a comment below and let me know which package
and version of that package you were using. Thanks in advance!

## Further Reading

As of Aug 17th 2022 Gatsby released v4 of the MDX Plugin. You can read more about how to migrate from v3 to v4 in docs.
