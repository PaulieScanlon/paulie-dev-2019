Hi there! I'm excited, are you? Of course you are!

In Gatsby [4.19.0](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.19/) the team shipped the
[Gatsby Head API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-head/) üéâ

But what does this mean for you, and why am I excited?

## React Helmet

Historically the way to add indexable meta data to you Gatsby site's `<head>` element was to use a combination of
`react-helmet` and `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`, but rather worryingly,
[react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) hasn't really been updated since 2020. üò¨

### What does it mean for you?

Using an Open-source library that's not been well maintained can lead to headaches, as I'm sure you're well aware.

### Why Am I excited?

The Gatsby Engineering team recognizes this and have now moved all of that lovely Helmet functionality into the core
framework! ‚Äî Superb!

### Migration Options

To use the Head API today, upgrade to at least `4.19.0` and I'll now talk you through the steps required to migrate from
`react-helmet` to the Head API. There's two slightly different ways you might wish to approach this depending on if
you're using unique pages or template/layout file. (MDX Blog posts with `frontmatter` for example)

I've prepared an example repo and x2 PR's which you can use for reference.

#### Example Repo (Using React Helmet)

- ‚öôÔ∏è [gatsby-head-api-mdx](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-head-api-mdx)
  - [Gatsby Cloud Preview](https://gatsbyheadapimdx.gatsbyjs.io/)

#### PR's (Using The Head API)

- ‚öôÔ∏è [feat/use-head-api-fs-routes](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-head-api-mdx/pull/4)
  - [Gatsby Cloud Preview](https://gatsbyheadapimdx-featuseheadapifsroutes.gtsb.io/)
- ‚öôÔ∏è [feat/use-head-api-gatsby-node](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-head-api-mdx/pull/3)
  - [Gatsby Cloud Preview](https://gatsbyheadapimdx-featuseheadapigatsbynode.gtsb.io/)

## Getting Started

I've tried to consider the most common scenario based on the approaches I see many folks use. Your use case may well be
different.

### Remove React Helmet

```sh
npm uninstall react-helmet gatsby-plugin-react-helmet
```

```diff
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
-   'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',
    ...
  ]
};
```

### Page

Generally I see folks using an `<Seo />` component somewhere in a page or page template file. In the example repo please
have a look at
[src/pages/index.js#L9](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-head-api-mdx/blob/main/src/pages/index.js#L9), and
here's a similar looking code snippet.

#### Seo

```javascript
// src/pages/index.js

import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

import Seo from '../components/seo';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Seo title="Gatsby Head API MDX" />
      <main>...</main>
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

... and here's what the same page looks like using the Head API

#### export const Head

```diff
// src/pages/index.js

import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

import Seo from '../components/seo';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
-     <Seo title="Gatsby Head API MDX" />
      <main>...</main>
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default Page;

+ export const Head = () => {
+   return <Seo title="Gatsby Head API MDX" />;
+ };
```

### Seo component

Now you can remove any reference to `<Helmet />` from the `<Seo />` component.

```diff
// src/components/seo.js

import React from 'react';
- import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

const Seo = ({ title }) => {
  return (
-   <Helmet>
      <title>{title}</title>
-   </Helmet>
  );
};

export default Seo;
```

... and that's it!

### Frontmatter as title

The above example shows a simple method for "hard-coding" a title and passing it on to the `<Seo />` component via the
`title` prop. In Page templates you'll likely need to use the `title` as defined in the `frontmatter`. Take a look at
the src from the example repo:
[src/pages/posts/\{mdx.frontmatter\_\_title}.js#L43](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-head-api-mdx/blob/feat/use-head-api-fs-routes/src/pages/posts/%7Bmdx.frontmatter__title%7D.js#L43)

#### Head props

Before you get going, you might like to inspect the `props` passed to the Head API. They should be the same as what's
passed to the page, E.g.

```javascript
export const Head = (props) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(props, null, 2));
  return null;
};
```

In my example repo this results in something similar to the below.

```json
{
  "location": {
    "pathname": "/posts/this-is-post-one"
  },
  "params": {},
  "data": {
    "mdx": {
      "frontmatter": {
        "title": "This is post one"
      },
      "body": "..."
    }
  },
  "pageContext": {
    "id": "6aa907b2-4040-5e38-b6f0-4f1762068476"
  }
}
```

The bit I'm most interested in is `data.mdx.frontmatter.title` as this is what I'll need to pass on to the `<Seo />`
component to display in the HTML `<title />`.

```javascript
export const Head = ({
  data: {
    mdx: {
      frontmatter: { title }
    }
  }
}) => {
  return <Seo title={title} />;
};
```

Now when I visit each of the post pages in the browser I see the page title change in my browser tab, and when inspect
the DOM I see the following. _Notice: the data attribute on the title_. If it says `data-gatsby-head` you're all set!

```html
// http://www.mywebsite.com/post-one

<head>
  <title data-gatsby-head="true">This is post one</title>
</head>
```

... and that's it, for real this time!
