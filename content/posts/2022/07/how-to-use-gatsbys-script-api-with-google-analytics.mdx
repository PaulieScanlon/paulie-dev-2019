In this post I'll be explaining how to add Google's "new" Google Analytics Property (GA4) to your Gatsby Site using the
new [Gatsby Script API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-script/).

I'll be demonstrating how to use the `off-main-thread` strategy which is powered by
[Builder'io's](https://www.builder.io/) [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/). I wrote about this once before on
the [Gatsby Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/how-to-add-google-analytics-gtag-to-gatsby-using-partytown), but that
was before the release of Gatsby [4.15.0](https://changelog.gatsbyjs.io/#4.15.0). From
[4.15.0](https://changelog.gatsbyjs.io/#4.15.0) onwards Gatsby takes care of all of the nitty-gritty for you so there's
considerably less config required.

This post focuses on the Google Analytics 4 Property rather than the more recognizable Universal Analytics (UA)
property. Here's a little note from Google about why you should use GA4 rather than UA.

> Universal Analytics will no longer process new data in standard properties beginning July 1, 2023. Prepare now by
> setting up and switching over to a Google Analytics 4 property

Below are links to a minimal example repository on GitHub, and a
[Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/hosting) preview URL.

I won't go through the steps to create a GA4 Property in this post, but here's a link to Google's docs that should help
you on your way.

## Getting Started

### Upgrade

The Script API was released as part of Gatsby [4.15.0](https://changelog.gatsbyjs.io/#4.15.0), make sure you're on at
least this version or upgrade to the latest version of Gatsby. Here's a link to the
[Gatsby Changelog Prototype](https://changelog.gatsbyjs.io/) where you can see all the released versions and more
details about each release.

```shell
npm install gatsby@latest
```

### Remove Plugin

It's likely you'll have been using `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`, but after upgrading Gatsby you can uninstall it,
and remove it from the plugins array in `gatsby-config`.

```diff
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...
-   {
-     resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-google-analytics',
-     options: {
-       trackingId: 'UA-12345678-9'
-     }
-   }
  ],
};

```

### Partytown Proxy

Since you're in `gatsby-config.js` you'll need to add the following.

I've explained in more detail how Partytown proxies requests from Web Workers and how this usually ends up with
unfathomable CORS errors in this post:
[How to Add Google Analytics gtag to Gatsby Using Partytown ðŸŽ‰](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/how-to-add-google-analytics-gtag-to-gatsby-using-partytown)

```diff
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...
  ],
+ partytownProxiedURLs: [`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.GATSBY_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}`]
};

```

## Adding Scripts

This next bit entirely depends on how you've setup your Gatsby Site.

### Shared Component

It's quite common however to have a "shared" React component that is returned by `wrapRootElement` in both
`gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js`. There's a little more in the Gatsby Docs here:
[Usage in Gatsby SSR and Browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-script/#usage-in-gatsby-ssr-and-browser-apis)

In the example repo I've called this Component
[RootElement](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-script-component-google-analytics/blob/main/src/components/root-element.js),
and it looks a bit like this.

```javascript
// src/components/root-element.js

import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import { Script } from 'gatsby';

const RootElement = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Script
        src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.GATSBY_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}`}
        strategy="off-main-thread"
        forward={[`gtag`]}
      />
      <Script
        id="gtag-config"
        strategy="off-main-thread"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
          window.gtag = function gtag(){ window.dataLayer.push(arguments);}
          gtag('js', new Date()); 
          gtag('config', '${process.env.GATSBY_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}', { send_page_view: false })`
        }}
      />
      <div>{children}</div>
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default RootElement;
```

The `RootElement` Component is returned by `wrapRootElement` in both `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js` which looks
a bit like this.

```javascript
// gatsby-browser.js

import React from 'react';
import RootElement from './src/components/root-element';

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
  return <RootElement>{element}</RootElement>;
};
```

```javascript
// gatsby-ssr.js

import React from 'react';
import RootElement from './src/components/root-element';

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
  return <RootElement>{element}</RootElement>;
};
```

If you don't ensure that `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr` return the same DOM elements you'll likely see a React
error like this.

> Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server

You can read more about what that error means in the React Docs:
[Error Decoder](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/?invariant=418)

## Page Views

You'll notice from the above that in the `gtag` config `send_page_view` is set to `false`. This is just for the
_initial_ setup but naturally you'll want to fire off `page_view` events... because that's what Google Analytics is all
about amirite?

### Send Page Views

`onRouteUpdate` is one of Gatsby Browser's API's and fires whenever a route change is detected. This API has a
destructured parameter for the current location. This is perfect for sending to Google's `page_view` and will show up in
your Analytics Dashboard.

Here's how I've implemented it in `gatsby-browser.js`. You can see the complete `src` from the example repo here:
[gatsby-browser.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-script-component-google-analytics/blob/main/gatsby-browser.js)

```diff
// gatsby-browser.js

import React from 'react';
import RootElement from './src/components/root-element';


+ export const onRouteUpdate = ({ location }) => {
+  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
+    return null;
+  }

+  const pagePath = location ? location.pathname + location.search + location.hash : undefined;

+  setTimeout(() => {
+    if (typeof window.gtag === 'function') {
+      window.gtag('event', 'page_view', { page_path: pagePath });
+    }
+  }, 100);

+  return true;
+ };


export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => {
  return <RootElement>{element}</RootElement>;
};

```

## Google Admin Dashboard

This tripped me up but, make sure you've added your site URL to the Data Streams section of your Google Analytics
Dashboard otherwise Google won't be "listening" out of `page_view` events.

## And Finally

Here's a little screenshot of my Google Analytics Realtime Overview, et voila, there I am on the map. It works, lovely
stuff.
