In this post i'm going to introduce one of the concepts you can use when developing web pages/apps using
[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)

If you're not familiar with Theme UI take a moment to have a read of the docs... and if you're not familiar with
[CSS-in-Js](https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757) perhaps have a read up on that first.

I'm going to talk about one quite complicated but in my opinion unnecessary part of Theme UI and it's something that
took me a while to work out since the docs don't really mention this in a clear and concise way.

It's my hope that this post might clarify a couple of things and help lower the barrier to entry when using Theme UI. I
won't go into detail about how the CSS properties link to the their respective scales or keys... that's a post for
another time.

In the docs you'll see a code snippet like this.

```javascript
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui';

export default (props) => (
  <div
    sx={{
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      fontSize: 4,
      color: 'primary'
    }}
  >
    Hello
  </div>
);
```

When i first saw this i was like "What the flip is @jsx", and "where's the import for `React`" ... and then after a
while i read on and started to understand what `jsx` pragma actually is.

The TLDR version is as follows.

When you include `/** @jsx jsx */` in your React component you don't need to import React. This because the `jsx` pragma
kind of includes the functionality to transform JSX for us. The `jsx` pragma also allows a new "type" of HTML attribute,
it's called the `sx` prop which can be applied to any normal HTML element.

With the `sx` prop you can now style you UI using Theme UI's super powers.

If you'd like to know about more, have a read of this:
[What is JSX Pragma](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-08-02-what-is-jsx-pragma/)

No more naming of CSS classes, or importing global variables 🤢 and in no way will we need to worry about order of
specificity 🙌... nice ay!

But...

Importing `jsx` and having to explain the `jsx` pragma is all a bit unnecessary so i'm proposing we try this another
way.

Instead of doing what the docs say, try this approach instead.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Box } from 'theme-ui';

export default (props) => (
  <Box
    sx={{
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      fontSize: 4,
      color: 'primary'
    }}
  >
    Hello
  </Box>
);
```

You can see from the above that we don't need to import the `jsx` pragma and instead we can import React as we normally
would and then use one of the components that ships with Theme UI.... The `<Box />`

The Box is technically just a div but if you inspect a Theme UI element, there's a few things Theme UI does for us which
will save us time later.

_JavaScript for Box 👇_

```javascript
<Box>I'm a Box</Box>
```

_JavaScript for div 👇_

```javascript
<div>I'm a div</div>
```

<div>I'm a div</div>

_CSS for Box 👇_

```css
display: block;
box-sizing: border-box;
margin: 0;
min-width: 0;
```

_CSS for div 👇_

```css
display: block;
```

You can see from the above that the CSS for the `<Box />` includes some resets for us, eg. `box-sizing`,`margin` and
`min-width` and whilst in the past we _could_ have used a global CSS file that handles the resets, we don't want to use
global CSS because this is where problems arise.

Global styles and the dreaded `!important` are escape hatches. These are work arounds we've developed over the years to
compensate for some of the shortcomings of native CSS. But in the new world of CSS-in-Js these native shortcomings have
been removed which allows us to spend more time focussing on actually building something.

But wait, there's more, here's the `<Flex />` component that ships with Theme UI

_JavaScript for Flex 👇_

```javascript
<Flex>I'm a Flex</Flex>
```

_CSS for Flex 👇_

```css
display: flex;
box-sizing: border-box;
margin: 0;
min-width: 0;
```

...and you can see from the CSS snippet that the defaults that come with this component save us the time of adding them
ourselves. e.g `<Flex />` already has `display: flex;` Cool ay! 😎

One last thing. Theme UI also allows the Polymorphic `as` prop. Poly meaning **many**, and morphic meaning **forms** so
you can do things like this.

_JavaScript for aside 👇_

```javascript
<Box as="aside">I'm an aside</Box>
```

_CSS for aside 👇_

```css
display: block;
box-sizing: border-box;
margin: 0;
min-width: 0;
```

You'll see if you inspect the "I'm man aside" element that the actual HTML element is in fact an `<aside />` and it
still inherits all the resets from `<Box />`

The `as` props works with all manner of HTML elements... even inputs:

```javascript
<Box as="input" placeholder="I'm an input" />
```

... but don't do as above, use the `<Input />` component instead because it maps to the correct key in the theme object:
`forms.input`

```javascript
<Input placeholder="I'm an input" />
```

So now you know.

Everything's a `<Box />`... sort of
