In this post I'm going to discuss a new approach I've adopted when using [Styled Components](https://Styled
Components.com/), initially I wasn't sure what this approach was called but I do really like this suggestion from
[Pedro Duarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte) at [Modulz](https://twitter.com/modulz)

<Tweet tweetLink="peduarte/status/1295998559117074432" />

From the _outside_ when you use the Box component you can provide a `width` prop but instead of it simply being a string
value it's an array of values. Reading from left to right this will translate to the following:

- 0: The Box will be `width: 100%;` on small screens
- 1: The Box will be `width: 50%;` on medium screens
- 2: The Box will be `width: auto;` on large screens

NB: This is assuming in your application you have a set of breakpoints defined, for example:

```javascript
const breakpoints = ['576px', '768px', '992px'];
```

As my Tweet mentions both [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/responsive-styles) and
[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop#responsive-values) come with this kind of functionality built in, Styled
Components does not. That's not a bad thing, Styled Components is different in many ways to Chakra UI and Theme UI, but
rather than try to explain it myself here's the descriptions from each of the projects.

### Chakra UI

_"Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you all the building blocks you need to
build your React applications"_

### Theme UI

_"Theme UI is a library for creating themeable user interfaces based on constraint-based design principles"_

### Styled Components

"_Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress 💅🏾_"

The way I like to think about this is Styled Components gives you the tools you need to build everything yourself where
as Chakra UI and Theme UI give you the tools you need to build everything yourself + a load of stuff that's already
built for you and can easily be re-themed.

If you're using Styled Components and like the look of the **Responsive Array Syntax** I'm going to explain how to write
a utility function that you can gradually adopt without breaking anything.

Before I go too much further when I use Styled Components I don't use template literals which is what you'll see in the
[docs](https://Styled Components.com/docs/basics#getting-started), instead I prefer to use the _style object_ syntax.

There's a PR for the docs site I created in Mar 2019 that attempts to explain the _style object_ syntax which you can
see [here](https://github.com/Styled Components/Styled Components-website/pull/444). I think I still need to do some
work on that 😬 ... so in the meantime I've prepared a short post with the same usage examples:
[Styled Components Style Objects](/posts/2020/08/styled-components-style-objects/)

Ok, let's start!

## 1.

Create a test component, I've called mine `<MrButton />` because I'm a laugh.

```javascript
// mr-button.js
import styled from 'Styled Components';

const MrButton = styled.button({
  backgroundColor: 'hotpink',
  border: 'none',
  color: 'white',
  padding: 8,
  width: '100%'
});

export default MrButton;
```

## 2.

Make sure you've implemented `<MrButton />` somewhere in your app and are passing in an array of values via the
`backgroundColor` and `width` props.

```javascript
// app.js
<MrButton backgroundColor={['hotpink', 'mouve', 'purple']} width={['100%', '50%', 'auto']}>
  Click Me
</MrButton>
```

## 3.

Create a util function somewhere and call it `create-media-queries.js`

```javascript
// create-media-queries.js
export const createMediaQueries = (css) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(css, null, 2));
};
```

The first step is to make sure you're able to pass the `backgroundColor` and `width` props through the styled component
and on to the function. As mentioned above I prefer to use the _style object_ syntax because I find it easier to
destructure the props and to spread the return of the `createMediaQueries` function into the styles 🕺

```diff
...
// mr-button.js
import styled from 'Styled Components'
+ import { createMediaQueries } from '../utils'

const MrButton = styled.button(
  {
-   backgroundColor: "hotpink",
    color: "white",
    border: "none",
    padding: 8,
-    width: 100%
  },
+  ({ backgroundColor, width }) => ({
+    ...createMediaQueries([
+      {
+        property: "background-color",
+        values: backgroundColor
+      },
+      {
+        property: "width",
+        values: width
+      }
+    ])
+  })
);

export default MrButton;

```

If you've followed the steps above you should see a `console.log` like this: 👇

```javascript
[
  {
    property: 'background-color',
    values: ['hotpink', 'mouve', 'purple']
  },
  {
    property: 'width',
    values: ['100%', '50%', 'auto']
  }
];
```

Now you've confirmed the values passed in via the props get through the styled component and on to the
`createMediaQueries` function you can do something with them, but before I move on let's define an array of breakpoints.
You could put this array anywhere in your project but just for demo's sake I'll add it to the top of the
`create-media-queries.js` file.

```diff
// create-media-queries.js
+ const breakpoints = [576, 768, 992]

export const createMediaQueries = (css) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(css, null, 2));
}
```

The aim now is to create key values pairs for each property and each of the values, you'll also need to catch any values
passed in that aren't an array by using `Array.isArray()` and rather than `.map` them just return a key value pair.

```diff
// create-media-queries.js
const breakpoints = [576, 768, 992]

export const createMediaQueries = (css) => {
-  console.log(JSON.stringify(css, null, 2));

+  const cssKeyValuePairs = css.reduce((items, item) => {
+    const { property, values } = item;

+    items.push(
+      Array.isArray(item.values)
+        ? values.map((value) => ({
+            [property]: value
+          }))
+        : [{ [property]: values }]
+    );
+   return items;
+  }, []);

+  console.log(JSON.stringify(cssKeyValuePairs, null, 2));

}
```

Which should give you a `console.log` that looks like this: 👇

```javascript
[
  [
    {
      'background-color': 'hotpink'
    },
    {
      'background-color': 'mouve'
    },
    {
      'background-color': 'purple'
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      width: '100%'
    },
    {
      width: '50%'
    },
    {
      width: 'auto'
    }
  ]
];
```

The next part of the function will be responsible for assigning each of those values to an appropriate breakpoint value

```diff
// create-media-queries.js
const breakpoints = [576, 768, 992]

export const createMediaQueries = (css) => {

  const cssKeyValuePairs = css.reduce((items, item) => {
    const { property, values } = item;
    items.push(
      Array.isArray(item.values)
        ? values.map((value) => ({
            [property]: value
          }))
        : [{ [property]: values }]
    );
   return items;
  }, []);

-  console.log(JSON.stringify(cssKeyValuePairs, null, 2));

+  const cssToBreakpoints = [0, ...breakpoints]
+    .map((breakpoint, index) => ({
+      breakpoint: breakpoint,
+      css: cssKeyValuePairs
+        .map((array) => array[index])
+        .filter(Boolean)
+        .reduce((items, item) => {
+          items[`${Object.keys(item)}`] = `${Object.values(item)}`;
+          return items;
+        }, {})
+    }))
+    .slice(0, -1);

+  console.log(JSON.stringify(cssToBreakpoints, null, 2));

}
```

Which should give you a `console.log` that looks like this: 👇

```javascript
[
  {
    "breakpoint": 0,
    "css": {
      "background-color": "hotpink",
      "width": "100%"
    }
  },
  {
    "breakpoint": 576,
    "css": {
      "background-color": "mouve",
      "width": "50%"
    }
  },
  {
    "breakpoint": 768,
    "css": {
      "background-color": "purple",
      "width": "auto"
    }
  }
]
​
```

There's a couple of things this part of the function does so I'll talk through them.

```javascript
[0, ...breakpoints];
```

The above creates a new array and inserts a `0` at the beginning. You'll need the extra value at the start because
you're developing this function to be _mobile first_. The first value from the values array is the default style and
isn't part of a media query

```javascript
breakpoint: breakpoint;
```

The above creates a key value pair for the breakpoint value, eg `breakpoint: 0,`

```javascript
css: cssKeyValuePairs
  .map((array) => array[index])
  .filter(Boolean)
  .reduce((items, item) => {
    items[`${Object.keys(item)}`] = `${Object.values(item)}`;
    return items;
  }, {});
```

The above creates a new object called `css` and within it are the key values pairs from the first part of the function

```javascript
.slice(0, -1);
```

Next you'll need to remove the last item from the array since you shifted all the values up by one by inserting the `0`
at the start of the array... I know... _mobile first_ is a bit confusing.

The final part of the function is where you can create formed media queries that will work when used with the _style
object_ syntax

```diff
// create-media-queries.js
const breakpoints = [576, 768, 992]

export const createMediaQueries = (css) => {

  const cssKeyValuePairs = css.reduce((items, item) => {
    const { property, values } = item;
    items.push(
      Array.isArray(item.values)
        ? values.map((value) => ({
            [property]: value
          }))
        : [{ [property]: values }]
    );
   return items;
  }, []);

  const cssToBreakpoints = [0, ...breakpoints]
    .map((breakpoint, index) => ({
      breakpoint: breakpoint,
      css: cssKeyValuePairs
        .map((array) => array[index])
        .filter(Boolean)
        .reduce((items, item) => {
          items[`${Object.keys(item)}`] = `${Object.values(item)}`;
          return items;
        }, {})
    }))
    .slice(0, -1);

-  console.log(JSON.stringify(cssToBreakpoints, null, 2));

+  const cssMediaQueries = cssToBreakpoints.reduce((items, item) => {
+    const { breakpoint, css } = item;
+
+    breakpoint
+      ? (items[`@media screen and (min-width: ${breakpoint}px)`] = {
+          ...css
+        })
+      : (items = { ...css });
+
+    return items;
+  }, {});

+  console.log(JSON.stringify(cssMediaQueries, null, 2));

+  return {
+    ...cssMediaQueries
+  };

}
```

Which should give you a `console.log` that looks like this: 👇

```javascript
{
  "background-color": "hotpink",
  "width": "100%",
  "@media screen and (min-width: 576px)": {
    "background-color": "mouve",
    "width": "50%"
  },
  "@media screen and (min-width: 768px)": {
    "background-color": "purple",
    "width": "auto"
  }
}
```

In this step you'll use array reduce again to loop over the `cssToBreakpoints` array and "massage" it into a new shape.

The default `css` values are returned outside of a media query and the 2nd and 3rd set of values use the breakpoint
number and return a formed media query with the correct `css` values _injected_

I'm sure there's a million other ways to solve this problem but in my case it worked a treat. If you have any feedback
