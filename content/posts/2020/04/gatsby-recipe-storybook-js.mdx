If you haven't tried Gatsby Recipes yet you really should!

You can read a bit more about them [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-15-announcing-gatsby-recipes/) which
will give you a better overview of how they work, but to summarize here's a quote from Gatsby founder
[Kyle Mathews](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributors/kyle-mathews/)

> Gatsby Recipes, a new tool to automate common site building tasks.

To use recipes you must upgrade to the latest version of the Gatsby CLI

```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli@latest
```

You can then use a recipe by running something similar to the below in your CLI

```sh
gatsby recipes url-to-recipe/name-of-recipe.mdx
```

## The Storybook Problem

The problem in a nutshell is that Gatsby does a few things when you run either `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build` that
Storybook by default does not.

To get the two playing nicely together we need a custom webpack config and it's precisely tasks like this where Gatsby
Recipes can do the lions share of the work so you don't have to! 🦁

For instance, if you have any components that contain either a `<Link />` imported from `gatsby` or any GraphQL queries
you'll likely see an error not to dissimilar to this 👇

```javascript
ERROR in ../node_modules/gatsby/cache-dir/gatsby-browser-entry.js 25:4
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (25:4)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders
|
|   return (
>     <React.Fragment>
|       {finalData && render(finalData)}
|       {!finalData && <div>Loading (StaticQuery)</div>}

```

- The first reason we get this error is because Gatsby exports as ES6 and Storybook by default expects all code to be
  ES5 / CommonJs.
- The second reason is that the `gatsby develop` and `gatsby build` steps remove GraphQL queries, Storybook by default
  does not.

So that's the issue, but what can we do about fixing it?

## The solution

Storybook allows us to write our own webpack config and there's some docs on that
[here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configurations/custom-webpack-config/) but in short we need to push a new rule to
the Storybook webpack config that will mimic the Gatsby build steps.

This new rule will do the following things.

- Match all `js|jsx` file extensions
- Transpile all ES6 code found within them to ES5 / CommonJs
- Strip out any GraphQL queries
- Add the `react-docgen` plugin (not essential but i like prop documentation)

This doesn't sound like a huge job but if you're scared of Webpack like i am it's nice to be able to automate this step
so you can just get on and develop your UI.

So that's why i created this recipe.

## The recipe

The complete steps of my recipe are as follows:

- Install babel plugins and presets
- Install babel-plugin-react-docgen
- Install Storybook React NPM packages and addons
- Create custom Storybook webpack config (main.js) for `js|jsx`
- Configure Storybook / Gatsby Link settings (preview.js)
- Create example Link stories
- Add Storybook npm scripts to `package.json`

~~You can test out my recipe **gatsby-recipe-storybook-js** by running the following in your CLI~~

~~gatsby recipes
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-recipe-storybook-js/master/gatsby-recipe-storybook-js.mdx~~

## 🚨 Update:

This recipe is now part of the official Gatsby CLI 🎉 You can test it out by running the following in your CLI 👇

```sh
 gatsby recipes storybook-js.mdx
```

The repo can be found here on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-recipe-storybook-js) and if you're
interested in the Webpack config you can find that here in
[main.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-recipe-storybook-js/blob/master/recipe/main.js)

Oh and before i forget, make sure you've run `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build` _before_ you start Storybook, because we
need the relevant GraphQL data to exist before we run Storybook.

There's also a **TypeScript** flavor of this recipe, you can read about that here

Lemme know how you get on! [@pauliescanlon](https://twitter.com/PaulieScanlon)
