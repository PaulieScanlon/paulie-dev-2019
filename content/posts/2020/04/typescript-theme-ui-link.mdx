In a previous post; [gatsby-or-theme-ui-link](/posts/2020/04/gatsby-or-theme-ui-link/) i talked about how to cast a
Theme UI Link as `gatsby` Link... and that will work fine in **JavaScript** but as i've discovered when you attempt to
do the same thing in **TypeScript** you'll run into problems.

Not big problems, it's just TypeScript doing it's job and letting you know that you've neglected to tell your code
something important.

That was the case with me so i'm now going to elaborate on my previous post and explain how to create your own custom
Link component that meets the below **Acceptance Criteria**

- It will accept an `sx` prop

- It will extend and provide access to underlying `gatsby` Link props

- It will extend HTMLAnchorElement attributes

I'll briefly explain those three points.

1. The `sx` prop is part of the Theme UI JSX pragma and allows you to style any DOM node or component as if it were a
   component from Theme UI using the `sx` prop

2. The Link component imported from `gatsby` has super powers, it has some functional props and is location aware... we
   don't wanna lose this functionality.

3. It's still an `<a>` so should still behave like one.

If you need a little more guidance i've made a bare bones repo which you can see on GitHub
[PaulieScanlon/typescript-theme-ui-link](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/typescript-theme-ui-link) and most things i'll
be explaining in this post can be seen in the
[MrLinky.tsx](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/typescript-theme-ui-link/blob/master/demo/src/components/MrLinky/MrLinky.tsx)
file

## Recap

To recap this is where we left off with [gatsby-or-theme-ui-link](/posts/2020/04/gatsby-or-theme-ui-link/)

```javascript
// some-file.js
import React from 'react';
import { Link as GatsbyLink } from 'gatsby';
import { Link } from '@theme-ui/components';

const SomeComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Link sx={{ color: 'primary' }} to="/" as={GatsbyLink}>
        Back to home
      </Link>
      <Link sx={{ color: 'secondary' }} href="https://www.paulie.dev">
        https://www.paulie.dev
      </Link>
    </>
  );
};
```

If you try and do that in **TypeScript** you'll get an error because `to` isn't a recognized prop for Link.

Remember Link is effectively still Link from `theme-ui` and not quite yet a Link from `gatsby`

So what can we do about it? 🤔

## MrLinky

One way, and there may well be more ways to accomplish this but...

I created a _new_ component and called it **MrLinky** ... because it's confusing having all these components called
Link.

```javascript
// MrLinky.tsx

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, SxStyleProp } from "theme-ui";
import { FunctionComponent, AnchorHTMLAttributes } from "react";
import { Link, GatsbyLinkProps } from "gatsby";

export interface MrLinkyProps
  extends AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>,
    GatsbyLinkProps<{}> {
  /** Theme UI JSX pragma */
  sx?: SxStyleProp;
}

export const MrLinky: FunctionComponent<MrLinkyProps> = ({
  children,
  to,
  sx,
  ...rest
}) => (
  <Link
    to={to}
    sx={{ ...sx }}
    {...(rest as AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>)}
  >
    {children}
  </Link>
);
```

So what's going on here then?

1. First off we ditch the `React` import and replace it with the JSX Pragma from Theme UI which allows us to apply the
   `sx` prop to any DOM node, `div` `span` or a React component etc, in this case it's Link from `gatsby`

2. Then we add an `sx` prop so we can pass in styles from the parent and spread them inside the `sx` prop which is now
   accepted by our Link from `gatsby`.

3. We also need to pass on the `to` prop since this is what makes Link from `gatsby` an internal routing link.

4. Then finally spread the `rest` as we may want to pass on HTMLAnchorElement attributes, a `title` for example

The tricky part is typing all of these props. So let's have a look at the `interface`

```javascript
interface MrLinkyProps extends AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>, GatsbyLinkProps<{}> {
  /** Theme UI JSX pragma */
  sx?: SxStyleProp;
}
```

1. First we have to extend the interface to include `AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>` which will be handy if we
   want to pass on HTMLAnchorElement attributes.

2. Then include `GatsbyLinkProps<{}>` This comes from `gatsby` and is what gives the Link it's super powers.

   _I'll revisit the `GatsbyLinkProps<{}>` in another post as it relates to a TypeScript generic used to type the
   `location.state` shape, You could type as "any" for now_

3. Lastly "hand crank" the `sx` prop and type it as `SxStyleProp` from `theme-ui` which allows us to pass on any `sx`
   based styes which will get applied because the entire component is now JSX Pragma enabled. 😅

### Usage

And here you go, a new Link component that does all the things Link from `gatsby` does and all the things that Link from
`theme-ui` does... and it has a cooler name 😎

```javascript

<MrLinky to='/some-internal-link/'>Sone internal link</Link>
<MrLinky to='/some-internal-link/' title='Some Title'>Sone internal link</Link>
<MrLinky to='/some-internal-link/' sx={{color: "primary"}}>Sone internal link</Link>
<MrLinky to='/some-internal-link/' activeClassName='some-active-class'>Sone internal link</Link>

```

### Warning ⚠️

There is one caveat to using this method that i think you should know about. Theme UI also has a `variant` prop but
since **MrLinky** is actually a Gatsby link we won't be able to use variant as a prop like this 👇

```javascript
<MrLinky variant="links.navigation" />
```

...but we can still take advantage of the `variant` prop by passing it on via the `sx` prop e.g 👇

```javascript
<MrLinky to="/some-internal-link/" sx={{ color: 'primary', variant: 'links.navigation' }}>
  Sone internal link
</Link>
```

You might also want to spread some default styles inside the component to ensure it points at `styles.a` by default.

```javascript
// MrLinky.tsx

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, SxStyleProp } from "theme-ui";
import { FunctionComponent, AnchorHTMLAttributes } from "react";
import { Link, GatsbyLinkProps } from "gatsby";

import theme from "../../gatsby-plugin-theme-ui"; /** => import the theme **/

export interface MrLinkyProps
  extends AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>,
    GatsbyLinkProps<{}> {
  /** Theme UI JSX pragma */
  sx?: SxStyleProp;
}

export const MrLinky: FunctionComponent<MrLinkyProps> = ({
  children,
  to,
  sx,
  ...rest
}) => (
  <Link
    to={to}
    sx={{ ...theme.styles.a, ...sx }} /** => Add default styles before the sx  **/
    {...(rest as AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>)}
  >
    {children}
  </Link>
);
```

It's a small shortcoming in my opinion and keeping all the Gatsby Link super powers is well worth the _sacrifice_.

### End Warning ⚠️

## MrsLinky

For completeness i've also created a MrsLinky component which pretty much does the same thing but is straight up
**JavaScript** and uses `PropTypes` just to give you some indication of what the props are.

The `to` prop is marked as `isRequired` as it's also required by Link from `gatsby` under the hood. The remaining props
are marked as good old `any` because this is JavaScript so you can do whatever you like!

```javascript
// MrsLinky.js

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Link } from 'gatsby';

export const MrsLinky = ({ children, to, sx, ...rest }) => (
  <Link to={to} sx={{ ...sx }} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </Link>
);

MrsLinky.propTypes = {
  /** Gatsby internal route */
  to: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  /** Theme UI JSX pragma */
  sx: PropTypes.any,
  /** Inherited props from AnchorHTMLAttributes and GatsbyLinkProps  */
  rest: PropTypes.any
};
```
