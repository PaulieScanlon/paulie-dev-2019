This has been a labour of love but [www.skin-ui.com](https://www.skin-ui.com/) is now alive and kicking.

If you're using Theme UI for your Gatsby projects Skin UI can help you get started. By forking the default theme you can
have a play around with theme styles right in the browser!

There's a preview with some example Theme UI components and the full markdown spec so you can see what affect the theme
styles have on the UI.

If you sign up / login you can save your work and come back to it later.

And for convenience you can download your theme as a JavaScript object for use in your project and download the source
`.mdx` of the preview.

Happy themeing!
