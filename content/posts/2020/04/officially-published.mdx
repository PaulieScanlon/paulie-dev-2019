🎉

My work on [100DaysOfGatsby](/posts/2020/01/100DaysOfGatsby/) caught the eye of the editorial team and now Gatsby have
officially published my 100 days journey on their blog
[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-20-paulie-scanlons-journey-of-100-days/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-20-paulie-scanlons-journey-of-100-days/)

I couldn't be happier and it goes to show that a little hard work can go a long way!
