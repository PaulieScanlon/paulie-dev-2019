In a recent post i introduced [Gatsby recipes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-15-announcing-gatsby-recipes/) and
talked about a new recipe i created that automates the Storybook setup process
[gatsby-recipe-storybook-js](/posts/2020/04/gatsby-recipe-storybook-js/). You'll notice that this recipe is called
**gatsby-recipe-storybook-js** and focusses on the Webpack config for **JavaScript** projects.

In this post i'm going to introduce a **TypeScript** variant of the same recipe. The steps to the recipe are similar to
the JavaScript version but with some extra dependencies and one small snag which i'll explain shortly.

## The recipe

The complete steps of my recipe are as follows:

- Install TypeScript
- Install babel plugins and presets
- Install react-docgen-typescript-loader
- Install Storybook React NPM packages and addons
- Create custom Storybook webpack config (main.js) for `js|jsx` and `ts|tsx`
- Configure Storybook / Gatsby Link settings (preview.js)
- Create example Link stories
- Add Storybook npm scripts to `package.json`

~~You can test out my recipe **gatsby-recipe-storybook-ts** by running the following in your CLI~~

~~gatsby recipes
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-recipe-storybook-ts/master/gatsby-recipe-storybook-ts.mdx~~

## 🚨 Update:

This recipe is now part of the official Gatsby CLI 🎉 You can test it out by running the following in your CLI 👇

```sh
 gatsby recipes storybook-ts.mdx
```

## One small snag

In the previous JavaScript recipe i talked about the Webpack config required for Storybook to transpile JavaScript code
in to ES5 / CommonJs and when i initially wrote this recipe i removed the JavaScript part of the config and focussed on
the config to transpile from TypeScript to ES5 / CommonJs... i later discovered i need both.

The reason is, whilst this new Webpack config will transpile _your_ TypeScript code you'll also need to continue to
transpile any JavaScript ES6 code. (Gatsby is ES6)

In short if you're using TypeScript a Webpack config is required to transpile both `js|jsx` and `ts|tsx`

The repo can be found here on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-recipe-storybook-ts) and if you're
interested in the Webpack config you can find that here in
[main.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-recipe-storybook-ts/blob/master/recipe/main.js)
