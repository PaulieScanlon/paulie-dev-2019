At the time of writing this post [gatsby-remark-grid-system](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-remark-grid-system)
is still very much experimental, it is functional and has had mild testing.

#### So what is it?

It's a grid system, it's like when you use the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) grid system.
Using a set of class names `col-xs-12` `col-sm-6` etc you can create all kinds of page layouts.

[demo 🍱](https://gatsby-remark-grid-system.netlify.com/)

As far as i know when writing in markdown this isn't possible as each element, be it a `<p>`, `<img />` etc will always
be `display: block` and if thats the case the default behavior of `html` and `css` means that all elements will most
likely be positioned one after the other.

This is great in a mobile-first world as you don't always have the horizontal space to position elements side by side,
but what happens when you do? what happens if you're writing a blog post and have an image and next to it you'd like to
write something cool.

This is where having a grid system in markdown can really help.

I looked around for solutions and had in my mind that i'd like the developer experience to be as similar to the `html`
way as possible.

For those not familiar with Bootstrap, this is what i'm talking about.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col col-xs-12 col-sm-6">Left content</div>
  <div class="col col-xs-12 col-sm-6">Right content</div>
</div>
```

In the above example we wrap x2 `div` elements in a container `div` and give it a class name of `row` this means the row
will be a block level element and will occupy 100% of the screen width and force other elements that come after it,
below it.

The 'children' / the `div` elements inside the row are where we need to apply a bit of css. The first class, `col` sets
some default styles, `display: flex;` etc then the remaining classes relate to how many **col**umns the `div` elements
should occupy across a set of breakpoints.

In the above example we say at the **xs** breakpoint we should be 12 columns wide and at the **sm** breakpoint we should
be 6 columns wide.

This only really makes sense if you are familiar with a 12 column grid system... i'll try and explain.

If 12 = 100%, 6 (which is half of 12 and therefore half of 100) is 50%. This works all the way from 1 to 12.

100/3 for instance is 33 which can be used as a percentage. If you had 3 columns at 33% you'd have a 100% of the screen
width covered.

#### From divs to markdown

The plugin works like this...

```javascript
::: div row
    ::: div col|12|6
    Left content
    :::

    ::: div col|12|6
    Right content
    :::
:::

```

The x3 colons come from [remark-containers](https://github.com/nevenall/remark-containers) a plugin by
[Dan Behlings](https://github.com/Nevenall) which act as a kind of starting point for the transformation. When
remark-containers see's this pattern its able to transform it in to something more useful.

In my case i want to catch the first `div` element and add my own class of `row` then catch it's children and add some
`col` specific classes.

In the above example you'll see `col|12|6` where col is the class name followed by numbers separated by the pipe. These
are what's used to add the Bootstrap inspired class names.

The above translates to

```html
<div class="gatsby-remark-grid-system row">
  <div class="gatsby-remark-grid-system col col-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 ">Left content</div>
  <div class="gatsby-remark-grid-system col col-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-6">Right content</div>
</div>
```

The plugin ships with x4 breakpoints `[576, 768, 992, 1200]` and each in turn corresponds to a class name i.e xs = 576,
sm = 768 and so on.

Using this plugin you're now able to have a bit more control over horizontal layouts in markdown. I plan to add push and
pull options for more control over vertical stacking on the smaller breakpoints.

I'd really appreciate issues, comments or stars on [Github](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-remark-grid-system)
so if you are using this plugin in your project please do let me know what you think
