Hi all, I recently had a discussion with [Rahul](https://twitter.com/rahxul) on Twitter regarding building a
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) blog using only locally sourced `.json` files.

There are a number of ways to achieve this so here's a demo and a repo if you'd prefer to dive straight in.

- [Demo](https://gatsbylocalsourcenode.gatsbyjs.io/posts)
- Repo Branches
  - [main - (single source .json)](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node)
  - [multiple-json-files](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node/tree/feat/multiple-json-files)
  - [gatsby-plugins](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node/tree/feat/gatsby-plugins)

These are three main methods i'll be discussing

1. Sourcing data from a single `.json` file using Node.js
2. Sourcing data from multiple `.json` files using Node.js
3. Sourcing data from multiple `.json` files using Gatsby plugins

The first two methods use the
[sourceNodes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#sourceNodes) extension point which is
just one of the many [Gatsby Node API methods](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/)

The first two methods will also use the
[createNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createNode) action to inject "data" found in
the `.json` source files into Gatsby's GraphQL layer.

The last method will use only Gatsby Plugins.

All methods will be using the
[File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/) and all of the above
methods will eventually create `post` and `posts` in Gatsby's GraphQL layer which will be used by the "curly brace"
[syntax collection routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/#syntax-collection-routes)
method to create each of the "post" pages seen in the demo

## Single .json file

The code for this example can be found on this branch:
[main](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node), and the directory structure looks like this

```shell
content
   |-- MOCK_DATA.json

```

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js

const MOCK_DATA = require('./content/MOCK_DATA.json');

exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions: { createNode }, createContentDigest }) => {
  MOCK_DATA.forEach((data, index) => {
    createNode({
      ...data,
      id: `post-${index}`,
      internal: {
        type: `post`,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(data)
      }
    });
  });
};
```

From top to bottom here's what's going on.

1. Fist I `require` a single `.json` file called `MOCK_DATA.json`
2. Then by using the `sourceNodes` extension point I can access
   [Gatsby's Actions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/) and add my own code
3. I've used `forEach` to iterate over every object contained within the
   [MOCK_DATA.json](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node/blob/main/content/MOCK_DATA.json) file and
   "for each" object found I use [createNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createNode)
   to inject the "data" from each object into Gatsby's GraphQL layer along with some other required parameters, E.g
   `id`, `internal.type` and `internal.contentDigest`

Once Gatsby has created the node it's then query-able using GraphQL. An example query in GraphiQL would look like this
ðŸ‘‡

```shell
// gets all posts

  allPost {
    nodes {
      id
      title
    }
  }

```

```shell
// get a single post by `id`

  post(id: {eq: "post-0"}) {
    title
  }

```

The query names `post` and `allPost` are created by Gatsby using the name provided by `internal.type`

## Multiple .json files

The code for this example can be found on this branch:
[multiple-json-files](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node/tree/feat/multiple-json-files), and the
directory structure looks like this

```shell
content
   |-- 01-Mar-2021.json
   |-- 05-Jul-2020.json
   |-- 07-May-2020.json
   ...
```

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js

const { readdirSync, readFileSync } = require('fs');

exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions: { createNode }, createContentDigest }) => {
  const DIR = './content';

  files = readdirSync(DIR);

  files.forEach((file, index) => {
    // ignore files starting with a dot
    if (!/^\..*/.test(file)) {
      let data = JSON.parse(readFileSync(`${DIR}/${file}`));

      createNode({
        ...data,
        id: `post-${index}`,
        internal: {
          type: `post`,
          contentDigest: createContentDigest(data)
        }
      });
    }
  });
};
```

This approach is a bit more of a rascal because each object from the previous example has now been extracted into
individual `.json` files and named by date.

1. First I use the `sourceNodes` extension point so I can access
   [Gatsby's Actions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/) plus add my own code
2. I've used Node's `readdirSync` to read the directory
3. Then "for each" over each file found in that directory and use `readFileSync` and `JSON.parse` to read the data
   contained within the file before using
   [createNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createNode) to inject the "data" into
   Gatsby's GraphQL layer

As above once Gatsby has created the node it's then query-able using GraphQL. An example query in GraphiQL would look
the same as above but here it is again ðŸ‘‡

```shell
// gets all posts

  allPost {
    nodes {
      id
      title
    }
  }

```

```shell
// get a single post by `id`

  post(id: {eq: "post-0"}) {
    title
  }

```

## Gatsby Plugins

The code for this example can be found on this branch:
[gatsby-plugins](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-local-source-node/tree/feat/gatsby-plugins), and the directory
structure looks like this

```shell
content
   |-- 01-Mar-2021.json
   |-- 05-Jul-2020.json
   |-- 07-May-2020.json
   ...
```

Using this final approach it's possible to avoid `gatsby-node.js` altogether and instead achieve the exact same thing
using `gatsby-transform-json` and `gatsby-source-filesystem` and configuring them in `gatsby-config.js`

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-json`,
      options: {
        typeName: `post`
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/content`,
        ignore: [`**/\.*`] // ignore files starting with a dot
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

By setting the `typeName` in the `gatsby-transformer-json` options to 'post' Gatsby will again create `post` and
`allPost` meaning the nodes continue to be query-able as mentioned above using GraphQL. An example query in GraphiQL
would again look the same as above E.g ðŸ‘‡

```shell
// gets all posts

  allPost {
    nodes {
      id
      title
    }
  }

```

```shell
// get a single post by `id`

  post(id: {eq: "post-0"}) {
    title
  }

```

## Final Thoughts

It took me a little while to understand how GraphQL nodes were created by Gatsby and it's fair to say that a lot of the
source plugins remove the need for you to ever understand what's going on under the hood but my hope is by explaining
how Gatsby does this will make your life a bit easier when you come to work with these nodes when using either
[page queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/recipes/querying-data/#querying-data-with-a-page-query),
[useStaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/recipes/querying-data/#querying-data-with-the-usestaticquery-hook) or as
i've done in this demo the
[File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/) and
[syntax collection routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/#syntax-collection-routes)
method.

If you've found any of the above confusing please do come find me on Twitter as i'm always happy to discuss.

Cheerio!
