Hello! If you're reading this you probably already know about Gatsby Plugin Image, but if not here's a recap:
[Announcing: Gatsby Plugin Image with Laurie Barth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRtFwzF4p1o)

The new plugin is super dooper and there's been some great demos from the community but I was curious about one of the
helper functions right at the bottom of the docs called
[withArtDirection](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image/#withartdirection)
that no one was really talking about.

## What's withArtDirection?

In short it's a way to show different images to the user via media queries but, without loading additional images into
the DOM using the `<img />` tag and slowing down the initial page load speed.

Here's a demo site and repo for you to have a look at, and in the rest of this post i'll try to explain a little more
about each of the examples

- [Demo](https://gatsbypluginimagewithartdirect.gatsbyjs.io/animation)
- [Repo](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction)

## Animation

In this first example I went mega overboard and instead of adding two or three media queries I added over a thousand!

<Tweet tweetLink="PaulieScanlon/status/1380067456606175232" />

The reason there's so many media queries is because i'm swapping an image out at each and every `px` value between
**576px** and approx **1967px** using
`@media (min-width 576px), @media (min-width 577px), @media (min-width 578px) ... and so on`

Each media query will show a new image which, in this example is a single frame from an animated walk cycle

Because media queries fire when the browser is resized it's possible to control the playback of the animation. If you
make your browser smaller Mr Lemon will walk forward, if you make your browser larger again Mr Lemon will walk backwards
(because the frames are now reversed)

To achieve this I start with 48 single `.jpg` files,
[you can see these images in the repo here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/tree/main/src/images/lemon)
and theb by using `gatsby-source-filesystem` i'm able to then query them using GraphQL

```javascript
const {
  allFile: { nodes }
} = useStaticQuery(graphql`
  query {
    allFile(filter: { sourceInstanceName: { eq: "lemon" }, ext: { eq: ".jpg" } }, sort: { fields: name, order: DESC }) {
      nodes {
        name
        sourceInstanceName
        childImageSharp {
          gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
        }
      }
    }
  }
`);
```

The nodes returned by this query look a little like the below:

_I've removed some parts of the returned values for brevity_

```javascript
[
  {
    name: '01-lemon',
    sourceInstanceName: 'lemon',
    childImageSharp: {
      gatsbyImageData: {
        images: {
          sources: [
            {
              srcSet: '/static//01-lemon.webp 750w'
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: '02-lemon',
    sourceInstanceName: 'lemon',
    childImageSharp: {
      gatsbyImageData: {
        images: {
          sources: [
            {
              srcSet: '/static/02-lemon.webp 750w'
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
];
```

Then using these `nodes` it's possible to pass them on to the `withArtDirection` helper function

```javascript
const images = withArtDirection(
  getImage(nodes[0]),
  []
    .concat(...new Array(29).fill(nodes))
    .map((frame, index) => {
      return {
        media: `(min-width: ${576 + index}px)`,
        image: getImage(frame)
      };
    })
    .reverse()
);
```

- The first argument of `withArtDirection` is the default image, in my case it's the first node in the index. E.g
  `nodes[0]`
- The second argument is an array of images to use across however many breakpoints you define.

In my example the second argument is a concatenated array of all the `nodes` but repeated **29** times. This was to
ensure I could incrementally increase the `min-width ...px` value to a high enough number for the resize effect to work
on really large monitors. E.g up to **1967px**

The return includes both the media query and the image data. I use a helper function here to. This one is called
[getImage](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image/#getimage)

This all results in 1,391 media queries, and each will show a frame from the original 48 `jpg`'s.

I've mentioned in the example site that i'm not sure why you'd want to use this but it is kinda cool that it's possible
and that browsers can even handle this many media queries. Chrome does struggle a bit with this to be honest but Firefox
on my mac plays these back quite smoothly.

## Aspect Ratio

This example is probably a little less of an edge case and it reminds me of what the social media advertising dweebs
refer to as "vertical video". Generally, for social media users will be on their phones and generally phones will be
held in the portrait orientation.

With this in mind it's sometimes more effective to show a video in it's vertical format. (It saves the user rotating
their phone to see smaller details in an ad)

The same might also be helpful on the web and by using a much simpler `@media` query it's possible to show a landscape
image to users on larger, wider screens and a portrait image to users on smaller, narrower screens.

To achieve this I start with x1 landscape image and x1 portrait image,
[you can see these images in the repo here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/tree/main/src/images/aspect-ratio)

The GraphQL query is pretty much the same as the above but only returns x2 nodes.

Then using those nodes it's possible to pass them on to the `withArtDirection` helper function

```javascript
const images = withArtDirection(getImage(nodes[0]), [
  {
    media: `(max-width: 576px)`,
    image: getImage(nodes[1])
  }
]);
```

- As above the first argument is the default image to display before the `@media` query kicks In
- The second argument again is an array but this time it's an array of only one item.

This media query is kind of the wrong way round ("desktop first") because i'm using `max-width` rather than the "mobile
first" approach of using `min-width`. I found that if I did this the other way round the aspect ratio was more difficult
to control.

This approach also requires a little bit of CSS. You can see below that `GatsbyImage` has a `className` of
`art-directed` which I use to set the `height` of the image for screen sizes below **576px**

_This is CSS-in-Js syntax FYI_

```javascript

'.art-directed': {
    height: 'auto'
},
'@media (max-width: 576px)': {
    '.art-directed': {
        height: 600
    }
}

<GatsbyImage className="art-directed" alt="animals" image={images} />

```

[full component `src` here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/blob/main/src/components/aspect-ratio.js)

## Desktop First

Since we're talking about "desktop first", in this example I tried to be a little bit cheeky and present the user with a
different image on smaller screen sizes. It's broadly the same as the Aspect Ratio example except in this example both
images are landscape.

If you're hearing claims that "no one uses the site on mobile" then surely there's no harm in displaying joke images for
users on smaller screens... because there aren't any users on smaller screen right?

In all seriousness this method is actually pretty helpful. You could perhaps tailor make designs, or change crops to
make images look better when viewed on smaller screens

To achieve this I start with x2 landscape images,
[you can see these images in the repo here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/tree/main/src/images/desktop-first)

The GraphQL query is pretty much the same as the above and only returns x2 nodes.

Then using those nodes it's possible to pass them on to the `withArtDirection` helper function

```javascript
const images = withArtDirection(getImage(nodes[1]), [
  {
    media: `(min-width: 576px)`,
    image: getImage(nodes[0])
  }
]);
```

- As above the first argument is the default image to display before the `@media` query kicks In
- The second argument again is an array but this time it's an array of only one item.

Unlike the Aspect Ratio in this example i'm using a "mobile first" approach and have set the default image to
`nodes[1]`. The media query takes care of displaying `nodes[0]` which is the "desktop" design you see in the demo, and
this image is shown on screen sizes above **576px**

[full component `src` here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/blob/main/src/components/desktop-first.js)

## Printer

To the best of my knowledge this example only works in Firefox but the idea is similar to the above but instead of using
a screen width `@media` query this time I use a `print` media query.

The thinking behind this is to surprise the user if they were to print your webpage. Instead of seeing what they saw on
screen they'd see a different image. You could use it for additional fun marketing or as i've tried to do remind the
user that printing things isn't that great for the environment.

To achieve this I start with x2 landscape images,
[you can see these images in the repo here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/tree/main/src/images/printer)

The GraphQL query is pretty much the same as the above and only returns x2 nodes.

Then using those nodes it's possible to pass them on to the `withArtDirection` helper function

```javascript
const images = withArtDirection(getImage(nodes[0]), [
  {
    media: `print`,
    image: getImage(nodes[1])
  }
]);
```

- As above the first argument is the default image to display before the `@media` query kicks In
- The second argument again is an array but this time it's an array of only one item.

Depending on how your GraphQL query returns these images will determine which `node[n]` is the default and which one is
displayed when the media query kicks in

You can see the
[full component `src` here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-plugin-image-with-art-direction/blob/main/src/components/printer.js)

That just about wraps things up. If you have any ideas about how else to use `withArtDirection` please come find me on
Twitter and we'll have chat.

Cheerio!
