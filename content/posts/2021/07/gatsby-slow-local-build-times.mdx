Ahoy, as the title suggests in this post I'm going to explain one way to resolve the "slow local build time" issues I
know lots of you experience with Gatsby.

It's worth pointing out that in this post I'll specifically be referring to sites that source `.md` from the local file
system. (Same applies for `.mdx` or `.json` FYI)

However, I'm pretty confident a similar approach would work when sourcing data from remote sources, be it from your own
implementation of `sourceNodes` or perhaps when using one of the many source plugins... the latter however is 100%
dependant on if the plugin author has exposed a method to limit how much data is being sourced.

If you wanna jump ahead here's a demo repo:
[https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-slow-local-build-times](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-slow-local-build-times)

## How much data is being sourced

In short this is the crux of the _problem_. If you're sourcing loads of data the Gatsby build steps are delayed while
Node / `gatsby-source-filesystem` do their thing.

In order to speed that bit up it's advised you limit the amount of data you're sourcing.

## gatsby-source-filesystem

This plugin is usually responsible for sourcing files. In the demo repo I'm sourcing Markdown files from the `content`
directory, and I'd imagine you'll have something similar to the below in your `gatsby-config`

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `markdown-pages`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/content`
      }
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-remark`
  ]
};
```

The main thing to look at is the `path`. The above snippet will source **everything** from the `src/content` directory.

## Do you need to source everything

Good question right? Well, in `production`, mostly likely the answer will be yes. In `development` however, probably
not.

** This was my penny drop moment! **

I have to admit I'm a little annoyed with myself for not thinking of this solution sooner, and, I don't mind admitting,
a little embarrassed too!

When I'm developing a new feature for my blog or writing a new post I don't need to see all of the blog posts, generally
a handful of the latest posts will be enough.

So the above could now look like this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
require('dotenv').config({
  path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`
});

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `markdown-pages`,
        path: process.env.NODE_ENV === `development` ? `${__dirname}/src/content/2021` : `${__dirname}/src/content`
      }
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-remark`
  ]
};
```

Using a ternary operator and testing if `process.env.NODE_ENV` equals `development` I can either source a smaller
amount: `src/content/2021` or **all** of the content: `src/content`

Such a simple trick and I can't believe I hadn't thought of it before. You live an learn ay! ðŸ¤¦

Anyway, give it a go, I'm pretty sure with this little trick you'll get those all important speedy local build times
back.

See you around the internet ðŸ•º
