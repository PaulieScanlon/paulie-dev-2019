Hi friends, yesterday I published a little post about how to
[Add data to Gatsby's GraphQL layer using sourceNodes](/posts/2021/07/gatsby-source-nodes/), this post will be expanding
on the topic of data management but this time i'm going to hone in on how to modify GraphQL's inferred data types so
that you can use the new upgraded [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/) with
remotely sourced images.

If you'd prefer to jump ahead here's a demo repo:
[https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/nasa-image-type](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/nasa-image-type)

... and a live demo can be seen here: [https://nasaimagetype.gatsbyjs.io/](https://nasaimagetype.gatsbyjs.io/)

## The Problem

The "problem" with remotely sourced images is that they are usually returned by API's as url's, E.g
`http://example.com/images/some-image.jpg`

When GraphQL see's this it correctly infers the data type as a `String`. However, in order for
[gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/) to process the image there are two
requirements.

1. The GraphQL node must be of type `File`
2. The image needs to have been downloaded and exist on your local filesystem

In this post i'll explain how you can satisfy both of these requirements using a combination of
[createRemoteFileNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/#createremotefilenode) from
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/) and
[createSchemaCustomization](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createSchemaCustomization)
which is utility function available in the
[Gatsby Node API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/)

The code i'll be explaining below expands on yesterday's post:
[Add data to Gatsby's GraphQL layer using sourceNodes](/posts/2021/07/gatsby-source-nodes/) so i'd advise you have a
read of that before diving in.

## Pre-Flight Checks

You'll need to have all the following dependencies installed and configured in `gatsby-config.js` The docs can be found
here: [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/#installation)

```shell
yarn add gatsby-plugin-image gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-sharp # npm install gatsby-plugin-image gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-sharp --save
```

To use the approach I'll be using below you'll also need to have
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=gatsby-source) installed, but
don't worry about adding it to `gatsby-config.js`

```shell
yarn add gatsby-source-filesystem # npm install gatsby-source-filesystem --save
```

If you don't already have one, you'll need a `gatsby-config.js` at the root of you project:

```shell
...
src
gatsby-config.js
package.json
```

And finally you'll need to add the following to `gatsby-config.js`

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
      options: {
        defaults: {
          quality: 70,
          formats: ['auto', 'webp', 'avif'],
          placeholder: 'blurred'
        }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

I prefer to set the defaults for `gatsby-plugin-sharp` in my `gatsby-config.js`, this is optional, but i'd advise it.

## 1. Source The Image

The following code can all be written in `gatsby-node.js`

I use [onCreateNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#onCreateNode) which is a Gatsby
function called each time a new node is created. By using an `if` condition I'm able to only call `createRemoteFileNode`
if the `node.internal.type` equals `apod`, which is the new node I created in yesterday's post.

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
const { createRemoteFileNode } = require('gatsby-source-filesystem');

exports.onCreateNode = async ({ node, actions: { createNode }, createNodeId, cache, store }) => {
  if (node.internal.type === 'apod') {
    node.image = await createRemoteFileNode({
      url: node.url,
      parentNodeId: node.id,
      createNode,
      createNodeId,
      cache,
      store
    });
  }
};
```

Starting from the top I destructure `createRemoteFileNode` from `gatsby-source-filesystem`, more on that in a moment.

Next I define and export `onCreateNode`. onCreateNode can be an `async` function and accepts a number of parameters
including but not limited to the following.

- node
- actions
- createNodeId,
- cache
- store

#### node

This is the new node type sourced from the NASA API and already exists in Gatsby's data layer

#### actions

Actions are the equivalent to actions bound with [bindActionCreators](https://redux.js.org/api/bindactioncreators/) in
Redux. `actions` contains a function called
[createNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createNode) and this is how you add data to
the Redux state object / Gatsby's data layer

#### createNodeId

This is effectively a helper function that aids in the creation of unique id's. Under the hood Gatsby are using
[uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid), you can of course use your preferred method but since uuid is already part
of the Gatsby bundle it makes sense to use it.

#### cache

Cache is the `.cache` directory Gatsby creates in/on your local filesystem

#### store

This is Gatsby's Data layer / The Redux state object

To the best of my knowledge all of the above are required. You might not see errors if you don't include `cache` or
`store` when creating a remote file node but I have experienced odd behavior if I failed to included them.

**The next bit deals with sourcing the image using the image url returned by the NASA API.**

#### node.image

I create a new object on the node and call it `image` which will be the response from `createRemoteFileNode`.

### createRemoteFileNode | params

This function comes from [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/) and
accepts the following parameters

- url
- parentNodeId
- createNode
- createNodeId
- cache
- store

#### url

The source url of the remote file

#### parentNodeId

The id of the parent node (i.e. the node to which the new remote File node will be linked to.

#### createNode

The action used to create nodes, I covered this in more detail in yesterday's post
[#actions-createNode](https://paulie.dev/posts/2021/07/gatsby-source-nodes/#actions-createNode)

#### createNodeId

A helper function for creating node ids, I covered this in more detail in yesterday's post
[#createNodeId](posts/2021/07/gatsby-source-nodes/#createNodeId)

#### cache

As above

#### store

As Above

With all of the above in place you should now be able to query the new `image` node in the GraphiQL explorer. Visit
[http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) to investigate.

```graphql
{
  apod {
    url
    image {
      relativePath
    }
  }
}
```

Which should give you a response similar to the below

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "apod": {
      "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2107/AR2835_20210701_W2x1024.jpg",
      "image": {
        "relativePath": ".cache/caches/default-site-plugin/bcd18c3c0f372d1ad0d180fa82cde702/AR2835_20210701_W2x1024.jpg"
      }
    }
  },
}
```

You can see the new `image` node and by querying the `relativePath` you can see that the file exists on disc in the
`.cache/caches` directory. Compare this to the `url` which has remained as it was, a remote url.

This satisfies **one** of the two requirements I mentioned above, but GraphQL still thinks the data type is a
`String`... but we know it's now actually a `File`

## 2. Modify the GraphQL type

To see GraphQL's inferred types Gatsby have exposed an additional action called
[printTypeDefinitions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#printTypeDefinitions) which can be
called from Gatsby Node using this function:
[createSchemaCustomization](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node#createSchemaCustomization)

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions: { createTypes, printTypeDefinitions } }) => {
  printTypeDefinitions({ path: './typeDefs.txt' });
};
```

If you've added the above to `gatsby-node.js` you can now run `gatsby build` and you should see a file pop up in your
filesystem called `typeDefs.txt`. Open it and scroll to the bottom, i've removed quite a lot from the below snippet for
brevity, but the main thing to notice is that GraphQL has inferred that the new `image` node has a child node called
`url` and is typed as a `String` ðŸ‘Ž

```graphql
type apod implements Node @derivedTypes @dontInfer {
  ...
  title: String
  url: String
  image: apodImage
}

type apodImage @derivedTypes {
  ...
  url: String
}

```

To correct this you can manually override GraphQL's type inference and provide your own type definitions. You can do
this by using `createTypes` from `actions`

```diff
exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({
  actions: { createTypes, printTypeDefinitions }
}) => {
+  createTypes(`
+    type apod implements Node {
+      image: apodImage
+    }
+    type apodImage @dontInfer {
+      url: File @link(by: "url")
+    }
+  `);

  printTypeDefinitions({ path: './typeDefs.txt' });
};
```

This looks a little peculiar if you're new to GraphQL and being honest I found this really difficult so here's my best
attempt to explain what's going on.

#### type apodImage

`apodImage` first needs to be set to `@dontInfer`. This is a way to tell GraphQL that I know best and i'll handle the
types so don't worry about inferring the data type.

#### url

Finally it's here where I tell GraphQL that the `image.url` is of type `File` and I link it to the `url` defined by the
`url` parameter from `createRemoteFileNode` ðŸ¥µ

If you delete the `typeDefs.txt` file from your local filesystem and run `gatsby build` again and investigate the types
you should now see the following.

```graphql

type apod implements Node @dontInfer {
  ...
  title: String
  url: String
  image: apodImage
}

type apodImage {
  url: File @link(by: "url")
}

```

And now GraphQL correctly understands that `image.url` is of type `File` -- Hooray! ðŸŽ‰

This now satisfies **both** of the above mentioned requirements!

_If you see any weird looking errors in your terminal it might be best to run `gatsby clean` before running
`gatsby build` since we're messing with a few low level things_

## Using GatsbyImage

`gatsby-plugin-image` exports two components, `<StaticImage />` and `<GatsbyImage />` I won't explain why we need to use
`<GatsbyImage />` but there's a good explanation in the docs:
[Using the Gatsby Image components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/?=gatsby-plugin-image#using-the-gatsby-image-components)

With the type now set as `File` you can now query the `image.url` using `childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData`. The query
i've used in [index.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/nasa-image-type/blob/main/src/pages/index.js) looks a little
something like this

```graphql
{
  apod {
    id
    date
    explanation
    media_type
    service_version
    title
    url
    image {
      url {
        childImageSharp {
          gatsbyImageData
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which should return something similar to the below. You should be able to see the various image data objects,
`placeholder`, `images`, and `sources`. All of this can be passed on to the `<GatsbyImage />` component.

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "apod": {
      "id": "63a09eef-2a28-5632-94c6-50061b62a0bf",

          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
}
```

## Jsx

To return the above image data you can use `<GatsbyImage />` with the `getImage` helper to pass the data on to
`<GatsbyImage />` via the`image` prop

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby';
import { GatsbyImage, getImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image';

const IndexPage = () => {
  const {
    apod: { id, date, explanation, media_type, service_version, title, image }
  } = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      apod {
        id
        date
        explanation
        media_type
        service_version
        title
        image {
          url {
            childImageSharp {
              gatsbyImageData
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return (
    <main>
      <p>{date}</p>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{explanation}</p>
      <GatsbyImage alt={title} image={getImage(image.url)} /> // oh hai!
      <p>{`id: ${id}`}</p>
      <p>{`media_type: ${media_type}`}</p>
      <p>{`service_version: ${service_version}`}</p>
    </main>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;
```

... and there you have it, modifying GraphQL's data types for remotely sourced images! I've used this approach many
times in various projects and covered it quite conclusively with [Benedicte Raae](https://twitter.com/raae) on our pokey
internet show
[Gatsby Deep Dives with Queen Raae and the Nattermobs Pirates](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9W-8hhRoLoN7axEFJQ17rJvk2KTiM2GP)

If you're looking for a similar solution when working with remote images in Markdown or MDX I wrote a post that can be
found on the Gatsby blog:
[MDX Embedded Images with the All-New Gatsby Image Plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/mdx-embedded-gatsby-image/)
