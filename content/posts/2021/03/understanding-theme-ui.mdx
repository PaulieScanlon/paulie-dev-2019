If you're new to [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started) or have ben thinking about getting started with
CSS-in-Js Theme UI is a great choice. The docs are great but there were one or two things that tripped me up when I
started using it.

In the below 6 posts you'll find code snippets and examples for the main areas I felt needed a little more clarification
than the docs provided.
