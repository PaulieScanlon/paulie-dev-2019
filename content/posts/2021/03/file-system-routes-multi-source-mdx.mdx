In this post I'm going to provide an example of how to use Gatsby's
[File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/) to source MDX files from
multiple locations anywhere in you projects directory structure.

- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-multi-source-mdx)

When I first read the docs for the
[File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/) I didn't initially make
the connection between "file system" and "route", but in short the idea behind this API is that Gatsby will create URLs
in accordance with how you've organized your `pages` directory, E.g

```sh
|-- src
  |-- pages
     |-- about.js
```

Which would produce an about page on a route or URL like this, E.g [~~http://localhost:8000~~/about]() or
[~~www.example.com~~/about]()

Using the file system in this way it makes it quite easy to determine the eventual URL of any given page of your
website, and this also works for nested directories, E.g

```sh
|-- src
  |-- pages
     |-- company
        |-- about.js
```

Which would produce a route or URL like this [~~http://localhost:8000~~/company/about]() or
[~~www.example.com~~/company/about]()

_The above is actually default Gatsby behavior and uses the Files System Route API under the hood. In this post I'll be
taking it a step further and demonstrate the power of "programmatically" naming directories and files. For completeness
I did want to point out that Gatsby is able to create routes from any `.js|tsx|md|mdx` file(s) found under `src/pages`_

However things get a little more dicey if:

1. You want to source from outside of `src/pages`
2. If the "page" is used to programmatically render content written in MDX

To address one issue at a time. First I'll deal with sourcing from outside of the `src/pages` directory

## 1. gatsby-source-filesystem

For example, If I wanted to source my MDX from a directory called `things` which has x2 sub directories called `posts`
and `projects` E.g

```sh
|-- src
  |-- things
     |-- posts
        |-- post-1.mdx
     |-- projects
        |-- project-1.mdx
  |-- pages
```

I'd install `gatsby-source-filesystem`, add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js` and use multiple resolvers to source from
multiple file system locations. E.g

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/things/posts`
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/things/projects`
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

## 2. gatsby-plugin-mdx

Because my "source" is MDX I'd also install `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`

```diff
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/things/posts`,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/things/projects`,
      },
    },
+    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  ],
}
```

Whilst this will indeed "source" my MDX from the above locations they're not actually pages yet!

To turn them into pages Gatsby needs to be told about them... and Gatsby is expecting to be told about them in
`src/pages`

## src/pages

It's here were I can leverage the _magical_ curly braces that you might have seen mentioned in the
[docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/)

In the demo repo you'll see I have something like this üëá

_Just a heads up but, notice `content` is a sub directory of `pages` which is where the magic will happen_

```sh
|-- src
  |-- things
     |-- posts
        |-- post-1.mdx
     |-- projects
        |-- project-1.mdx
  |-- pages
     |-- content
        |-- {mdx.frontmatter__variant}
           |-- {mdx.slug}.js
```

## frontmatter

If you're familiar with MDX you'll probably already know about `frontmatter` but for those who don't `frontmatter` is a
_special_ way to store and then later query and render additional information about an MDX file.

Here's the `frontmatter` used in
[post-1.mdx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-multi-source-mdx/main/src/things/posts/post-1.mdx)
from the demo repo

```sh
---
title: A post called post 1
variant: posts
tags: [React, Gatsby, MDX]
---

...

```

and here's the `frontmatter` used in
[project-1.mdx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-multi-source-mdx/main/src/things/projects/project-1.mdx)
from the demo repo

```sh
---
title: A project called project 1
variant: projects
client: Boogy Inc
---

...

```

Since `posts` and `projects` will likely be used differently there are some differences in the `frontmatter` but, both
contain a field called `variant`.

The `variant` is what's used by the File System Route API and can be seen in the above directory name
`{mdx.frontmatter__variant}`

_The double underscore denotes that `variant` is a nested property of the `frontmatter` object_ ‚òùÔ∏è

For clarity if I run the below query in GraphiQL

```sh
{
  mdx {
    frontmatter {
      variant
    }
  }
}
```

I'll see something similar to this üëá

```sh
{
  "data": {
    "mdx": {
      "frontmatter": {
        "variant": "posts"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By translating `src/pages/content/{mdx.frontmatter__variant}` Gatsby will produce URLs that looks like this üëá

- [~~http://localhost:8000~~/content/posts]() or [~~www.example.com~~/content/posts]()
- [~~http://localhost:8000~~/content/projects]() or [~~www.example.com~~/content/projects]()

Now that I'm able to create a URL from a directory structure and a programmatically generated directory name I can move
on to creating a page for each MDX file that's been sourced.

The next bit is a bit vexing so strap in üò¨

## Programmatic page

If I run the below query in GraphiQL

```sh
{
  mdx {
    slug
  }
}
```

I'll get an output something like this üëá

```sh
{
  "data": {
    "mdx": {
      "slug": "post-1"
    }
  },
}
```

The `slug` is the actual file name on disk E.g `post-1.mdx`, and I use this to create the next part of the URL by using
the curly braces as a "programmatic page" file name E.g `{mdx.slug}.js`

The reason I have a programmatic page is because I'll want to process all the `posts` and `projects` MDX files in the
same way.

By process I mean for **both** `posts` and `projects` I'll want to do the following:

- Turn them in to pages
- Query the `frontmatter`
- Determine which page template to use
- Add a "Back" link

```javascript
// src/pages/content/{mdx.frontmatter__variant}/{mdx.slug}.js

import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import { graphql, Link } from 'gatsby';

import PostsTemplate from '../../../templates/posts-template';
import ProjectsTemplate from '../../../templates/projects-template';

const MdxPage = ({
  data,
  data: {
    mdx: {
      frontmatter: { variant }
    }
  }
}) => {
  const templates = {
    posts: <PostsTemplate data={data} />,
    projects: <ProjectsTemplate data={data} />
  };

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Link to="/">Back</Link>
      {templates[variant] ? templates[variant] : null}
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      frontmatter {
        title
        variant
        tags
        client
      }
      body
    }
  }
`;

export default MdxPage;
```

You can see the `src` file for the above
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-multi-source-mdx/blob/main/src/pages/content/%7Bmdx.frontmatter__variant%7D/%7Bmdx.slug%7D.js)

The main point to notice is that i'm using the `variant` to conditionally render a page template.

## Page Template

A page template can be used to render the specific data found in the `frontmatter`. As mentioned above `posts` and
`projects` have slightly different `frontmatter`

For example `posts` have a field in the `frontmatter` called `tags` which is an array of strings. In
[posts-template.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-multi-source-mdx/blob/main/src/templates/posts-template.js)
I map over this array to create a list.

In
[projects-template.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-multi-source-mdx/blob/main/src/templates/projects-template.js)
there's no need to create a list for the tags because there's no `tags` field present in the `frontmatter`. Instead
there's a `client` field in the `frontmatter` which I render as an `<h3>`

It's an odd concept to get your head around at first. `src/pages` is in many ways completely un-related to where you
chose to locate your source files and those curly braces are a bit odd when you first see them.

What I have found however is that by running the query in GraphiQL first I'm able to better visualize what the actual
value inside the curly braces will be and in turn what the resulting URL will look like, you might find that helpful too
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To note, the File System Route API can also be used with data sourced remotely. In past projects i've used it in
combination with [sourceNodes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#sourceNodes),
`createNodeId` and `gatsby-node.js`

See you around!
