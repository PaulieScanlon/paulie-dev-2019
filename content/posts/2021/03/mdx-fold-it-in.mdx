import CustomBlockquote from './custom-blockquote';

In this post i'm going to discuss the term **"Fold it in"** which I think was first coined by
[spences10](https://twitter.com/spences10) and it relates to a method of using React Components in
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) without the need to import them each and every time.

This term may or may not make 100% sense but naming things is hard and having a shorter way to describe an approach or
method in my experience can be quite helpful, but whatever, "you do you"

On a recent stream with my NatterPops chums we implemented MDX in [Benedicte's](https://twitter.com/raae) blog and we
did _attempt_ to explain what we meant by "fold it in" You can watch that below.

In an attempt to explain a little more i've documented a couple of ways this approach can be used.

In this example i'll be specifically referring to methods I use in my Gatsby builds when working with MDX

## MDX

For those not familiar with MDX it's similar to Markdown and additionally provides a method to render React components
along with typical Markdown syntax... MDX is brilliant and I love it!

Here's an example üëá

```javascript
// some-blog-post.mdx

import CustomBlockquote from '../src/components/custom-blockquote'

## This is a heading written in markdown

This is the body written in markdown

And this is a React component üëá

<CustomBlockquote>This is a quote - from someone</CustomBlockquote>

```

This will result in something like the below üëá

<div
  style={{
    borderWidth: "3px",
    borderStyle: "dashed",
    borderColor: "white",
    padding: '32px',
    margin: '32px 0px'
  }}
>

## This is a heading written in markdown

This is the body written in markdown

And this is a React component üëá

<CustomBlockquote>This is a quote - from someone</CustomBlockquote>

</div>

You'll see near the top of `some-blog-post.mdx` there's a familiar looking `import` statement, this is pretty much what
you'd expect to see if you were in Jsx land.

The `import` statement works the same way in MDX and allows you to import React components and render them alongside the
usual Markdown syntax, but because it's a React component you can be a little more _fancy_. In this example i've added
x2 SVG quote icons either side of the text.

This approach works great for "one off" components but in the case of the `<CustomBlockquote />` you might want to use
it more regularly when writing blog posts and having to import it for each and every MDX file can be a bit of a faff.

## Fold it in

It's at this point where you might like to think about providing all MDX files with the ability to render the
`<CustomBlockquote />` component without needing to import it first. It's here where the term "fold it in" makes a bit
more sense.

By "folding" the component in to the `<MDXProvider />` it will be ready to use by any MDX file without the need to
import it first.

Your implementation of MDX will likely be different to mine but you will probably have an `<MDXProvider />` somewhere in
your project. Here's a stripped back MDX Template file.

```javascript
// src/pages/{mdx.slug}.js

import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

const MdxTemplate = ({
  data: {
    mdx: {
      body,
    },
  },
}) => {
  return (
    ...
    <MDXProvider>
      <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </MDXProvider>
    ...
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      body
    }
  }
`;

export default MdxTemplate
```

## MDXProvider

To "fold" components into MDX I use the `components` prop on the `<MDXProvider />` and pass in the components i'd like
to make available to all MDX files.

```diff
// src/pages/{mdx.slug}.js

import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

+ import CustomBlockquote from '../../components/custom-blockquote'

+ const mdxComponents = {
+  CustomBlockquote
+ }

const MdxTemplate = ({
  data: {
    mdx: {
      body,
    },
  },
}) => {
  return (
    ...
-    <MDXProvider>
+    <MDXProvider components={mdxComponents}>
      <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </MDXProvider>
    ...
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      body
    }
  }
`;

export default MdxTemplate
```

Now that the `<CustomBlockquote />` component has been "folded" in there's no need to import it in the MDX blog post.

```diff
// some-blog-post.mdx

- import CustomBlockquote from '../src/components/custom-blockquote'

 ## This is a heading written in markdown

 This is the body written in markdown

 And this is a React component üëá

 <CustomBlockquote>This is a quote - from someone</CustomBlockquote>

```

I've been asked a number of times about how this might affect bundle size / page size because using this method bundles
the `<CustomBlockquote />` component with each page regardless of if it's being used or not.

I have to be honest I don't know if that's actually the case. My assumption would be that webpack is smart enough to
know if a component is in use or not and therefore would only bundle the `<CustomBlockquote />` as and when it's
required but that's all a bit _low level_ for me.

If you have questions surrounding the potential performance impacts of using this approach you might like to ask either
[Chris Biscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi) or [John Otander](https://twitter.com/4lpine), they're both very
approachable chaps and were heavily involved in the creation of MDX.

However, if you have any other questions i'll do my best to answer them!

## MDXRenderer

In the above example i'm using the `<MDXProvider />` from `@mdx-js/react` and passing in a React component, in this next
bit i'm going to use the `<MDXRenderer />` from `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to fold in "data".

I'll use the `<CustomBlockquote />` component again but this time rather than rendering it's children i'm going to pass
data stored in `frontmatter` back through the `<MDXRenderer />` and make it available as a `prop` in the MDX body ü•¥

### Frontmatter

First I add a new field in `frontmatter` called `quotes`, it's of type `array` but looks like a list syntax in Markdown.
If the below diff is a little hard to read, the `quotes` field should look like this, the `---` are important as they
signify the beginning and end of `frontmatter`

```javascript
---
 quotes:
   - 'this is a quote 1 - from someone a'
   - 'this is a quote 2 - from someone b'
   - 'this is a quote 3 - from someone c'
---
```

### Props instead of children

This is a weird one, but notice now instead of rendering the children of `<CustomBlockquote />` as text I'm using an
escaped Jsx syntax and pointing it to `props.quotes[0]`

_The `[0]` is normal array syntax and represents an index from an array_

```diff
// some-blog-post.mdx

+ ---
+ quotes:
+   - 'this is a quote 1 - from someone a'
+   - 'this is a quote 2 - from someone b'
+   - 'this is a quote 3 - from someone c'
+ ---


 ## This is a heading written in markdown

 This is the body written in markdown

 And this is a React component üëá

- <CustomBlockquote>This is a quote - from someone</CustomBlockquote>
+ <CustomBlockquote>{props.quotes[0]}</CustomBlockquote>
+ <CustomBlockquote>{props.quotes[1]}</CustomBlockquote>
+ <CustomBlockquote>{props.quotes[2]}</CustomBlockquote>

```

### MDXRenderer Props

In order for `props.quotes[0]` to equal something other than `null` I now query the `frontmatter` from the MDX Template
file and pass the `quotes` back to the `<MDXRenderer />` on a prop i've also called `quotes`

```diff

// src/pages/{mdx.slug}.js

import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

import CustomBlockquote from '../../components/custom-blockquote'

const mdxComponents = {
  CustomBlockquote
}

const MdxTemplate = ({
  data: {
    mdx: {
+     quotes,
      body,
    },
  },
}) => {
  return (
    ...
    <MDXProvider components={mdxComponents}>
-     <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
+     <MDXRenderer quotes={quotes}>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </MDXProvider>
    ...
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
+     frontmatter {
+       quotes
      }
      body
    }
  }
`;

export default MdxTemplate
```

This is a slightly contrived example but I suppose it might be useful if you had a really long blog post with lots of
quotes and rather than having to scroll through the page and find one that might need editing you could find the quote
in question by looking at the top of the file in the `frontmatter`. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A more "Real World" example of how the `<MDXRenderer />` can be used to pass data from `frontmatter` back to the MDX
`body` can be see in this rather outdated post: [MDX Embedded Images](/posts/2020/04/mdx-embedded-images/).

In [this](/posts/2020/04/mdx-embedded-images/) post I pass local image files from `frontmatter`, process them with
`childImageSharp` in the MDX Template before passing them back to the `<MDXRenderer />` to display them anywhere in the
MDX body.

Phew... that just about wraps things up... see you around üï∫
