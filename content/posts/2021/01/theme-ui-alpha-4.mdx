In this post i'm going to explain how Theme UI's [Theme Scales](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#theme-scales) work. If
you're new to Theme UI i'd suggest having a read of the first three posts in this series to bring you up to speed

- 1. [Understanding Theme UI: 1 - Jsx Pragma](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-1/)
- 2. [Understanding Theme UI: 2 - Styled component](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-2/)
- 3. [Understanding Theme UI: 3 - Components](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-3/)

Before we dive in i'm going to pull a statement from the [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) homepage and try and draw
some comparisons between Theme UI and what we already understand about CSS.

> Build themeable design systems based on constraint-based design principles

The bit i'd like to hone in on is where it says "constraint-based". For some having a CSS framework that comes with
constraints might be a bad thing, personally for me, it's a really powerful thing.

Theme UI works by "mapping" certain CSS properties to a targeted object within the main theme object, and encourages you
to _only_ use values defined in the corresponding _scale_.

For example using any of the above methods, (Jsx Pragma, Styled or Components) you'll likely need to apply padding to a
HTML element. Here's an example.

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    padding: 4
  }}
>
  I'm a Box
</Box>
```

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  ...
  space: [
    '0px',
    '4px',
    '8px',
    '16px',
    '32px',
    '48px',
    '64px'
   ]
}
```

You'll see in the above "src" that the `<Box />` has a CSS property of `padding` which is assigned a value of 4, but
what is 4?

Here's some things it's not

- 4px
- 4em
- 4rem

What 4 relates to is the index in the `space` array defined in the theme. In this case 4 is <mark>**"32px"**</mark> ,
and the reason this value is stored in the `space` array is because one of Theme UI's constraints is to map `padding` to
`space`. The _longhand_ for what this might look like in Object Oriented Programming is `theme.space[4]`

You can see the full set of scales in the [docs](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#theme-scales) which explain where each
CSS property looks in the theme to find it's value.

## Array Syntax

I've gleaned from various discussions about Theme UI that the array syntax for `space` can be a little confusing so to
throw an alternative method in to the mix, `space` can also be an object. I suspect Theme UI don't mention this in the
docs is because using an object syntax requires you give each key a name... and namings things is hard.

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    padding: 'lg'
  }}
>
  I'm a Box
</Box>
```

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  ...
  space: {
    none: '0px',
    xs: '4px',
    sm: '8px',
    md: '16px',
    lg: '32px',
    xl: '48px',
    xxl: '64px',
  }
}
```

## Object Syntax

In this example `padding` is given a "string" value of "lg" and if you look in the `space` object you'll see the `lg`
key has a value of <mark>"32px"</mark>. The _longhand_ for this would be `theme.space.lg`

The `space` key names _could_ be anything you want, here's another example (i'm not suggesting you do this by the way)

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    padding: 'jaguar'
  }}
>
  I'm a Box
</Box>
```

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  ...
  space: {
    none: '0px',
    kitten: '4px',
    cat: '8px',
    cougar: '16px',
    jaguar: '32px',
    lion: '48px',
    tiger: '64px',
  }
}
```

## Alt Syntax

As per the previous example `padding` is given a "string" value of "jaguar" and if you look in the `space` object you'll
see the `jaguar` key has a value of <mark>"32px"</mark>

Any value mentioned in the `space` scale will work in this way, eg, `padding-top`, `margin`, `grid-gap` etc

Moreover any value named in the [scales](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#theme-scales) will work in this way. For
instance if you wanted to define a `background-color` for the box you could use `backgroundColor: "primary"`. The CSS
property for `background-color` is mapped to the colors object in the theme, or the _longhand_ would be
`theme.colors.primary`.

These constraints may seem foreign at first when working with Theme UI but _in theory_ CSS is by it's very nature
providing you with a set of constraints. For example when you use the `display` property in CSS you are only able to use
values from a constrained set as defined in the [CSS spec](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp) e.g:

- `inline`
- `block`
- `flex`
- `grid`

... and so on.

Theme UI's scales are way to _limit_ or _restrict_ values to a certain set or predetermined values, and why would you
need a constrained set of values I hear your cry... well, you don't it's entirely possible to give `padding:` any value
you like, e.g `padding: "100px"` but the point behind the constraints is to limit the amount of low level thinking you
need to do.

If you define a set of values for use around your site or application you'll only ever need to pick from a handful or
possibilities. If you don't have these constraints you may find yourself digging around the codebase to find a similar
component and try to match whatever hardcoded `px` value was used, or worse... you'll have to speak with the design
team.

So in my opinion constraints are a good thing.

Not every CSS property is mapped by Theme UI to a scale in the theme object, as mentioned `display` can be any value
defined in the CSS spec.

In the next post I'll be covering how to use breakpoints so sit tight and i'll be back with examples and explanations
for how to make your styles _responsive_ in Theme UI
