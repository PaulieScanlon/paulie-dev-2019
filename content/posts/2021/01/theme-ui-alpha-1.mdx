In this post I'm going to try and explain [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)'s Jsx Pragma. I hope to create a series of
these posts that might help lower to the barrier to entry when learning Theme UI... let's see how that goes ay!

I'll assume at this point you've already installed Theme UI but if you haven't, have a read of the
[Getting Started](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started) section from the docs

Before starting to explain the Jsx Pragma I'm going to walk you through some steps which I feel are important to
understand. The explanation might be a little convoluted but bear with me and hopefully once you reach the Jsx Pragma
section it'll make more sense.

To help demonstrate some of the Theme UI's principles we're going to build a very _simple_ component which you can see
below, i've called it `<MrPragma />` and you can find the `src`
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrPragma.js)

<CodeSandbox codeSandboxId="understanding-theme-ui-jsx-pragma-vjo1gd" />

## Theme Object

A core principle of Theme UI is the theme object it's a little bit like global CSS but without all the headaches.

This is key to understanding how Theme UI works so feel free to bookmark the
[theme-spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) page as i'll be referring it frequently.

When your first start your site after installing Theme UI you'll notice the background is a kind of fuchsia color.
That's fine, it means Theme UI is working and is applying its default styles.

Depending on which install method you've used will determine the file name and location of the theme object. I'm going
to base this post on the install method for
[gatsby-plugin-theme-ui](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/?=gatsby-plugin-theme-ui)

To change the default background and text colour you'll need to add a `colors` key to the theme object that contains key
value pairs for both `text` and `background`

```javascript
// src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js

export default {
  colors: {
    text: '#FFFFFF',
    background: '#131127'
  }
};
```

By default Theme UI will use `text` and `background` to style the body `color` and the body `background-color` and
before we go any further I'd like to explain why.

Theme UI's opening gambit if you like is as follows:

> Build themeable design systems based on constraint-based design principles

The bit i'd like to point out is where it says "constraint-based design principles". Theme UI makes some decisions for
us so we don't have to, and when working with CSS some constraints are actually really really helpful. _In a later post
I'll explain how to use Theme UI's escape hatches if you don't want or can't in some scenarios work with the
constraints_

### CSS Property maps

This is my opinion is one of the hardest concepts to grasp. The TLDR is Theme UI has made decisions regarding which CSS
properties map to which objects in the theme object. The HTML `color` and `background-color` are mapped to the `colors`
object which is why the changes above will have an effect on your overall site theme. More on this later

### Object-oriented Programming (OOP):

Theme UI uses OOP to allow access to CSS properties defined in the theme object.

As a practical example go ahead and create a `<MrPragma />` component and ensure you can render it to a page as we'll
need to see the output of a `console.log()`

```javascript
// MrPragma.js

import React from 'react';
import theme from '../gatsby-plugin-theme-ui';

console.log(theme);

export const MrPragma = () => {
  return <div>MrPragma</div>;
};
```

The above will log out the entire theme object. You should see all the default styles and if you've implemented the
above change to `colors` you should see that `text` and `background` are the same as the values you've defined.

To go one step further change the `console.log()` so it only logs out the values for the `text` key

```diff
// MrPragma.js
import React from "react"
import theme from "../gatsby-plugin-theme-ui"

- console.log(theme)
+ console.log(theme.colors.text)

export const MrPragma = () => {
  return <div>MrPragma</div>
}
```

And now finally use this `text` value to style the `<div />`

```diff
// MrPragma.js

import React from "react"
import theme from "../gatsby-plugin-theme-ui"

console.log(theme.colors.text)

export const MrPragma = () => {
  return (
    <div
+     style={{
+       color: theme.colors.text,
+      }}
    >
      MrPragma
    </div>
  )
}
```

🚨🚨 This is NOT how you use Theme UI 🚨🚨

... but it does go some way to understanding what the theme object is and how you can access key value pairs contained
within it.

## Jsx Pragma

In the next step I'll explain how to achieve the same thing but by leverageing Theme UI's super power, The Jsx Pragma.

### Step One

W.T.Flip is [Jsx Pragma](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-08-02-what-is-jsx-pragma/)?... well, to quote the Gatsby
docs

> A pragma is a compiler directive. It tells the compiler how it should handle the contents of a file.

You can take from that what you will but in short the Jsx Pragma allows Jsx to compile things in a special way. In the
case of Theme UI we need the compiler to understand and compile something called
[The sx Prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop) and it looks like the below.

_Theme UI's Jsx Pragma already includes React so you'll notice in the below i've removed the React import_

```diff
// MrPragma.js

+ /** @jsx jsx */
+ import { jsx } from "theme-ui"
- import React from "react"
- import theme from "../gatsby-plugin-theme-ui"

- console.log(theme.colors.text)

export const MrPragma = () => {
  return (
    <div
+     sx={{}}
-     style={{
-       color: theme.colors.text,
-      }}
    >
      MrPragma
    </div>
  )
}
```

If you're familiar with HTML you'll know that `sx` isn't a valid HTML attribute but by including Theme UI's Jsx Pragma
the compiler understands what it is and will know what to do with it before the Jsx is returned to the browser.

### Step Two

Use the `sx` prop to style a `<div />`

```diff
// MrPragma.js

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

export const MrPragma = () => {
  return (
    <div
     sx={{
+     color: "text"
     }}
    >
      MrPragma
    </div>
  )
}
```

You'll notice here that `text` is a string. The word or string "text" in CSS wouldn't normally mean anything since CSS
will be expecting an actual hex reference for a `color` property e.g: `#FFFFFF` but since the `sx` prop is compiled
using the Jsx Pragma Theme UI is able to look up what the string value refers to in theme object.

The reason you don't need to write `theme.colors.text` is because Theme UI shorthands the OOP lookup for us by mapping
CSS properties of certain types to a constrained set of objects from the theme object

This is a small glimpse into Theme UI making decisions for us

In the case of the CSS property `color` Theme UI will map it to `theme.colors` which does indeed contain the key value
pair of `text`

Moreover if we introduce a new colour to the theme object called `surface` and give it a hex value we can then use it
with another CSS property that is also mapped to the `colors` object

```diff
// src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js

export default {
  colors: {
    text: "#FFFFFF",
    background: "#131127",
+   surface: "#232140"
  },
}
```

```diff
// MrPragma.js

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

export const MrPragma = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        color: "text",
+       backgroundColor: "surface",
      }}
    >
      MrPragma
    </div>
  )
}
```

The relationship between the CSS properties and where in the theme objet Theme UI will shorthand the lookup is detailed
in the [Theme Scales](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#theme-scales)

The first part of the Theme Scales table explains the following:

| Theme Key | CSS Properties                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| colors    | color, background-color, border-color |

This means that whenever you're applying a CSS property of `color`, `background-color` or `border-color` Theme UI will
automatically look to the `colors` object and return the resulting value.

This is just an introduction to Theme UI and in later posts i'll be explaining the relationship between CSS properties
and the theme object in more depth, so stay tuned and give me a follow on Twitter 🕺
