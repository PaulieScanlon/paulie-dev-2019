In this post i'm going to explain how Theme UI's [Responsive Values](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop#responsive-values)
work and to get us started...

> You don't need to write any `@media` rules because Theme UI handles this for you.

If you're new to Theme UI i'd suggest having a read of the first four posts in this series to bring you up to speed

- 1. [Understanding Theme UI: 1 - Jsx Pragma](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-1/)
- 2. [Understanding Theme UI: 2 - Styled component](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-2/)
- 3. [Understanding Theme UI: 3 - Components](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-3/)
- 4. [Understanding Theme UI: 4 - Scales](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-4/)

In [post 4](posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-4/) I discussed scales and as a bit of a recap Theme UI has pre-mapped certain
CSS properties to keys within the theme object. `breakpoints` can be considered the same way but instead of being mapped
to CSS properties they are used as a `min-width` value to form the CSS `@media` rule(s) and the `media` rules can be
applied to **any** CSS property via what I refer to as **Responsive Array Syntax**

I'm going to borrow the Object Syntax example from [this post](posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-4/#object-syntax) but i've
added a new `breakpoints` key to the theme object _(note: this is the default breakpoints array from Theme UI)_

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  className="demo-box"
  sx={{
    padding: ['xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg']
  }}
>
  I'm a Box
</Box>
```

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  ...
  space: {
    none: '0px',
    xs: '4px',
    sm: '8px',
    md: '16px',
    lg: '32px',
    xl: '48px',
    xxl: '64px',
  },
  breakpoints: ['40em', '56em', '64em']
}
```

I'd first like to discuss the **Src**. Notice instead of `padding` being a single value it's an array of values:

Reading the CSS properties from left to right on the `<Box />` above for `padding` the breakdown looks like this

<div
 style={{
   overflowX: 'auto',
   scrollBehavior: 'smooth'
 }}  
>

| property index | property | key | value | scale |
| -------------- | -------- | --- | ----- | ----- |
| 0              | padding  | xs  | 4px   | space |
| 1              | padding  | sm  | 8px   | space |
| 2              | padding  | md  | 16px  | space |
| 3              | padding  | lg  | 32px  | space |

</div>

Next have a look at the `breakpoints` array from the theme object.

_It's important to note here Theme UI works on the CSS `min-width` principle so what we see in the zero index of the
`breakpoints` array will actually end up being the **first** breakpoint where CSS will kick in. This is one of the many
tenants of **mobile first**... because we handle the CSS properties for "mobile", first._

How the breakpoints relate to the properties defined on the `<Box />` above breakdown like this.

<div
 style={{
   overflowX: 'auto',
   scrollBehavior: 'smooth'
 }}  
>

| property index | property | key | value | scale | breakpoint index | breakpoint value |
| -------------- | -------- | --- | ----- | ----- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0              | padding  | xs  | 4px   | space | n/a              | n/a              |
| 1              | padding  | sm  | 8px   | space | 0                | 40em             |
| 2              | padding  | md  | 16px  | space | 1                | 56em             |
| 3              | padding  | lg  | 32px  | space | 2                | 64em             |

</div>

I'd now like to translate the above table into the resulting CSS, I hope this will feel a little more familiar to you
since it's CSS

```css
.demo-box {
  padding: 4px;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  .demo-box {
    padding: 8px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
  .demo-box {
    padding: 16px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 64em) {
  .demo-box {
    padding: 32px;
  }
}
```

### no breakpoint

In the CSS above you can see that outside of any `@media` rule the `.demo-box` padding is set to `4px` this will be the
default styes applied to the `<Box />` until any of the `@media` rules kick in. It's resulting CSS property for padding
is derived from `space.xs` which if you refer to the theme object above has a value of "4px"

### breakpoint 0

This is the first time the `@media` rule will modify the styles and kicks in when the browser reaches a minimum width of
`40em`. The `min-width` value here is taken from breakpoints index 0 and the resulting CSS property for padding is
derived from `space.sm` which if you refer to the the theme object above as a value of "8px"

### breakpoint 1

This `@media` rule will modify the styles when the browser reaches a minimum width of `56em`. The `min-width` value here
is taken from breakpoints index 1 and the resulting CSS property for padding is derived from `space.md` which if you
refer to the the theme object above as a value of "16px"

### breakpoint 2

And lastly this `@media` rule will modify the styles when the browser reaches a minimum width of `64em`. The `min-width`
value here is taken from breakpoints index 2 and the resulting CSS property for padding is derived from `space.lg` which
if you refer to the the theme object above as a value of "32px"

Working with responsive values from theme scales is tricky to understand initially because you have to first understand
how `padding` maps to `theme.space` and then understand how each property from the responsive syntax array is applied
via a `@media` rule which is created based on values from the `breakpoints` array.

The above explains the principles but now I hope to demonstrate the same approach by using a more digestible example.
Again as above you'll need to resize your browser to see what happens to the `<Box />` across the breakpoints.

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    borderColor: ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'hotpink'],
    borderStyle: ['solid', 'dashed'],
    borderWidth: '6px'
  }}
>
  I'm a Box
</Box>
```

>

In this example i'm not using any values from the theme object, instead I'm using web safe colors for `borderColor`, a
hard-coded "px" value for `borderWidth` and valid `border-style` CSS properties for the `borderStyle`

If you resize your browser you'll notice the `borderColor` properties change across all breakpoints, the `borderStyle`
only changes when the first `@media` rule kicks in and `borderWidth` remains constant across all breakpoints.

From the above you should be able to see that Responsive Values can be applied to any CSS property and the amount of
values you add to the **Responsive Array Syntax** can vary. The only caveat being you can't have more values applied
than you have breakpoints defined.

Personally speaking when I was learning Theme UI I struggled to understand this concept at first but what helped was to
have a play with various CSS properties using the **Responsive Array Syntax** and seeing what effects it had when I
resized my browser.

Theme UI has done a hell of a job in abstracting `@media` rules and it really cleans up your Jsx. If you're interested
in how it works under the hood i've written an in depth post explaining how the same approach can be used with Styled
Components: [Styled Components Responsive Array Syntax](/posts/2020/08/Styled Components-responsive-array-syntax/)

This is the penultimate post in my Understanding Theme UI series. Next up is: _The hacks_ where I hope to explain how
you can target elements using various CSS selectors via the `sx` prop, how to use the theme function and as a little
bonus i'll be explaining how to use `@keyframes` so you can add pure CSS keyframe animation to site.

Thanks for reading!
