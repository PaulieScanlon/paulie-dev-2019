In this post i'm going to explain some of my Theme UI "hacks"... to be honest they're not really hacks but you won't
necessarily find these in the docs since they mostly relate to standard CSS selectors but it wasn't immediately obvious
to me that the `sx` prop can be used in this way.

If you're new to Theme UI i'd suggest having a read of the first five posts in this series to bring you up to speed

## Variants - Buttons

There are some obvious uses for variants that are explained in the docs but one method I use a fair bit isn't covered by
the docs so here's one way you can use variants inside the theme object.

Below is a method I use for styling button variants and as the [docs](https://theme-ui.com/components/button#variants)
mention the default variant is `theme.buttons.primary`. You'll see in the source below that if the `<Button />`
component is used without a variant prop it'll default to the styles in defined in `theme.buttons.primary`

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Button>Primary</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
```

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  colors: {
    text: '#FFFFFF',
    muted: '#8b87ea',
    primary: '#f056c7',
    secondary: '#c39eff',
    background: '#131127'
  },
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      backgroundColor: 'primary',
      borderRadius: 0,
      color: 'text',
      cursor: 'pointer',
      minWidth: 120,
      px: 3,
      py: 2
    },
    secondary: {
      variant: 'buttons.primary',
      color: 'background',
      backgroundColor: 'secondary'
    },
    ghost: {
      variant: 'buttons.primary',
      color: 'muted',
      backgroundColor: 'background'
    }
  }
};
```

To create alternative button variants I define them in the same `buttons` object and give each one a name. e.g
"secondary" and "ghost".

Like in normal CSS you'll want the additional button variants to extend the default class, in this case it's called
"primary" this is so you don't have to re-define or duplicate CSS properties for the `padding`, `min-with` etc and the
way to do this in Theme UI is to use the variant "prop" inside the theme object.

Looking at the object for `secondary` you'll notice it has a variant of `buttons.primary` this means it'll extend all
the CSS properties from the default button and will then apply / overwrite new CSS properties for it's `color` and
`backgroundColor`. You can use this approach for as many button variants as you require, but do always "extend" using
the variant before applying new styles.

## Variants - typography

This one is a bit gnarly so strap in. The concept here is that the variant prop used on the component can be used to
point to a specific set of styles in the theme, this can be any theme key, in the below example it's `styles` and as
seen in the button example above you can also extend from a theme object using the variant key

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Heading as='h3' variant='styles.h3'>Heading h3</Heading>
<Heading as='h4' variant='styles.h4'>Heading h4</Heading>
```

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  fonts: {
    heading: 'Inconsolata, monospace'
  },
  fontSizes: [12, 16, 18],
  text: {
    heading: {
      fontFamily: 'heading',
      fontSize: 2
    }
  },
  styles: {
    h3: {
      variant: 'text.heading',
      color: 'secondary'
    },
    h4: {
      variant: 'text.heading',
      color: 'text'
    }
  }
};
```

First thing to note with typography is that you'll most likely want to use the `as` prop to determine the HTML dom node,
but... this doesn't automatically mean HTML dom nodes map to styles. As an aside it's quite possible you'll want to
style `h(n)` tags differently on different pages and by de-coupling `as` from `variant` is quite handy albeit a bit
complicated to grasp at first.

With that out of the way we can move on to variants.

You'll see above in the above `<Heading as='h3' variant='styles.h3'/>` I map the variant to `styles.h3` and if you look
at the theme object for `styles.h3` it first extends the styles defined in `text.heading` and then applies a new CSS
property for `color`.

These styles are from my theme: [gatsby-theme-terminal](https://gatsby-theme-terminal.netlify.app/) and the typography
treatments are quite simple but hopefully you can see from the above how to map from component usage to a theme key
using the variant prop and from there you can extend from another theme key.

If you're coming to Theme UI from `.scss` it's a bit like `@extend` and if you're coming from `css-modules` it's a bit
like `composes`

_FYI The reason I point typography to `styles` is because the `styles` key is what Theme UI uses when styling HTML dom
nodes found in markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`)_

## CSS selectors

Every now and then you might run into an issue where you'll need to target a sibling or child of a Theme UI component.

I had this recently when I used the [Reach UI - menu-button](https://reach.tech/menu-button). For the purposes of an
example i've removed a lot of the code but the TLDR is that you can style any sibling or child from the `sx` prop using
normal CSS selectors

To target a child by `id` you can do this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    '#menu--1': {
      borderColor: 'primary',
      borderStyle: 'solid',
      borderWidth: '1px'
    }
  }}
>
  <div id="menu--1">...</div>
</Box>
```

To target a child by `class` you can do this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    '.menu': {
      borderColor: 'primary',
      borderStyle: 'solid',
      borderWidth: '1px'
    }
  }}
>
  <div className="menu">...</div>
</Box>
```

To target a child by `data-` attribute you can do this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    '[data-reach-menu-list="menu"]': {
      borderColor: 'primary',
      borderStyle: 'solid',
      borderWidth: '1px'
    }
  }}
>
  <div data-reach-menu-list="menu">...</div>
</Box>
```

To target an adjacent sibling by `class` you can do this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    '+ .menu': {
      borderColor: 'primary',
      borderStyle: 'solid',
      borderWidth: '1px',
    },
  }}
/>
<div className="menu">...</div>
```

To target a general sibling by `class` you can do this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    '~ .menu': {
      borderColor: 'primary',
      borderStyle: 'solid',
      borderWidth: '1px',
    },
  }}
/>
<div className="menu">...</div>
<div className="menu menu-items">...</div>
```

I've written a post about how to use "style objects" for use with Styled Components but the same approach works with
Theme UI. You can read more about "style objects" in this post: [Styled Components Style Objects](/posts/2020/08/Styled
Components-style-objects/)

## SVG paths

One "hack" I used extensively in [BumHub](https://gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-silly-site-top-20/) was to target the SVG's
`<path>` tags via a `className` to set their `fill` to colors defined in the theme. This way if you change any color
values for use around your site all your SVG's will update the same as any other HTML dom nodes.

_the colors seen below are inherited from the theme used in this blog_

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Box } from 'theme-ui';

export const LogoIcon = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      as="svg"
      sx={{
        '.logo-outline': {
          fill: 'surface'
        },
        '.logo-solid': {
          fill: 'primary'
        },
        '.logo-detail': {
          fill: 'text'
        }
      }}
    >
      <g>
        <path className="logo-solid" d="..." />
        <g className="logo-detail">
          <path d="..." />
          <path d="..." />
          <path d="..." />
          <path d="..." />
          <path d="..." />
        </g>

        <path className="logo-outline" d="..." />
      </g>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## css keyframes

This is a lesser understood part of CSS and arguably even more so with Theme UI as it's not mentioned in the docs
anywhere. However it is possible to animate using CSS keyframes using `keyframes` from `@emotion/react`

To help demonstrate how keyframes work here's a very _simple_ loading component called `<MrKeyframes />` and you can
find the `src` [here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/02/MrKeyframes.js)

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Box, Grid } from 'theme-ui';
import { keyframes } from '@emotion/react';

export const MrKeyframes = () => {
  const size = '8px';
  const dots = new Array(10).fill(null);

  const animation = keyframes({
    '0%': {
      opacity: 1
    },
    '20%': {
      opacity: 0
    },
    '100%': {
      opacity: 1
    }
  });

  return (
    <Grid
      sx={{
        gap: 1,
        p: 5,
        textAlign: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center'
      }}
    >
      Loading
      <Grid
        sx={{
          gridAutoFlow: 'column',
          gap: 2
        }}
      >
        {dots.map((dot, index) => (
          <Box
            key={index}
            sx={{
              animationDelay: `${index / 10}s`,
              animationDuration: '1.2s',
              animationTimingFunction: 'linear',
              animationIterationCount: 'infinite',
              animationName: animation.toString(),
              backgroundColor: 'primary',
              borderRadius: `${size}`,
              height: `${size}`,
              width: `${size}`,
              opacity: 0
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
};
```

## functional values

I've talked a lot about how Theme UI maps CSS properties to specific theme objects, e.g `color` and `background-color`
automatically map to `colors`... but if you need to access a value from your theme and map it to a different CSS
property you can do so by using [functional values](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop#functional-values)

The idea here is you pass the `theme` object on via an inline function and by using template literals you can construct
any CSS value you need.

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Box
  sx={{
    boxShadow: (theme) => `0 0 7px 3px ${theme.colors.secondary}`,
    backgroundColor: 'surface',
    color: 'secondary',
    p: 3
  }}
>
  I'm a Box
</Box>
```

I'm sure i've implemented a number of other CSS methods using Theme UI on various projects but I can't think of any more
right now. I'll endeavour to update this post as and when any new ones come to mind.

That just about wraps up this series on Theme UI, if you have any questions please feel free to find me on Twitter
