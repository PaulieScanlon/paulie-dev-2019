Hello there! In November 2022 I started a new role at [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/). I'm now what
we're currently calling a Developer Evidence Engineer ‚Äî And I'll now try and explain what that means and a little more
about the app I made for my interview.

If you'd like to skip ahead and see the app, there's a preview link below. Oh and the repo is Open-source.

## A Bit Of Background

Rewinding the clock slightly to 2005 when I was a Flash Developer and worked in Advertising, and back then we didn't
have teams to build websites, you just kind of did everything yourself. And this has stuck with me throughout my career.
Jobs that have made me unhappy were the jobs that required me to **only** write code.

## I Like Writing Code

And I do, but I also like doing other things. I like Design, I like Illustration, Branding, Animation, Motion Graphics,
Art Direction and Copy Writing, and Content Creation (which normally requires I use all of the above).

In more recent years however I've been eager to dust off my Advertising skills. I did a little bit of this when I was at
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), but working to a release cycle of every two weeks (because that's how often the
minor framework updates were published), I rarely had more than a few weeks to put something together. That wasn't the
reason I left though. I left because I'm looking to make a permanent move to the USA, and Gatsby as a fully remote
company probably wouldn't have been able to offer this. That said, they have just been acquired by Netlify so y'no ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Although, I'd imagine providing US visa sponsorship to existing employees wouldn't have been at the top of anyone's to
do list and could have delayed my plans to move. And who know's if I'd have even made the cut and kept my job through
the acquisition!

Anyway, best of luck to the team, you're all the best! üíú

## The Role at Cockroach Labs

When I first discussed the role at Cockroach Labs it became clear the timelines for launches were much, much longer.
This, in part is due to the date based release schedule of [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach),
about 4 times a year, not ~24 times a year like Gatsby!

This sounded like the breathing space I'd been looking for. Not that I want to slow my pace down but because I want to
ramp my production value up! I don't wanna make shitty looking demo apps that look like they've been made by an
Engineer, or create low-fi Tik-Tok style video content with the crazy-face YouTube thumbnails (ü§Æ). I can't do it, I
have a background in Advertising, delivery is everything!

## What is Developer Evidence?

It's a hybrid role, and probably a temporary title until I prove my worth üò∞. I'm part of the Product Marketing
Management (PMM) Team and am tasked with developing new "go to market" deliverables. To do this I'll need to call on my
whole skill set, this could be content creation, it could be demo apps, it might be motion graphics ‚Äî who knows! The
first two projects I'm working on don't even use the CockroachDB database, but promote the business benefits of
CockroachDB's distributed capabilities... how do you write code to demo that?

In and around the launches I'll be creating what I hope will be creative and imaginative thought provoking projects.
I'll no longer be focussed on the "how" a developer could do something, but "why" a business should do something.

No doubt I'll still make demo applications, and "how to do x..." blog posts, I don't want to stray too far from what I
enjoying doing and more often than not, when I'm working through a project, lots of little "spin off" content ideas come
to mind. I do enjoy the little things but what I'm really keen to explore is bigger projects that move the needle.

## My Interview Demo Application

Part of the interview process required I create a demo app, and the instructions were to spend no more than 3 hours on
it. I ignored this because you can't produce a polished looking demo in 3 hours üòä.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image1} alt="Edge Locations App" />

I spent around 2 days (the weekend) designing and building this demo app which I called
[Edge](https://cockroachdb-edge-locations.vercel.app/). To be fair, I had most of the 3D Globe already, I've used it on
my [/dashboard](/dashboard), and a few other projects.

The tech stack for this app is as follows.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
- [Tanstack / React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise)

and of course,

- [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach)

or more specifically [Cockroach Cloud](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup) because I'm using CockroachDB Serverless and
the app is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

There's a few more dependencies which you can see in the
[package.json](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-edge-locations/blob/main/package.json#L31).

### Lab Data

This is actually a problem that plagued me throughout my time at Gatsby. Whenever I needed to create a CMS Demo I'd have
to spend time populating the CMS with dummy posts and images and spend time finding content so I could demonstrate how
to query it and turn it into a page. This is still somewhat of a problem for creating demos using a Database, E.g. I
need some data in order to query it.

So for [Edge](https://cockroachdb-edge-locations.vercel.app/) I've made something that technically falls under the
category of "user generated content". But instead of me or you creating "content", all you have to do is click the
"submit" button and the code does the rest. I presented the app at each stage of my interview process and asked my
interviewers to submit their location while we were talking. ‚Äî I got the job, so I'm assuming they all liked what they
saw.

### How Edge Works

Clicking the ["Submit"](https://cockroachdb-edge-locations.vercel.app/) button calls a Serverless Function, which grabs
the `ip` address from the `req` object. It then uses the `ip` address to find the geographical location, looks this up
to get the latitude and longitude, and then POSTs them to a CockroachDB database ready to be consumed by the app. The
locations retrieved aren't actually your location, but they are the locations of **Vercel's Global Edge Network**.

To give you some idea about how close the edge really is, when I submit, the function returns a location that is 28
miles up the road from me in a different town. So if you wanna **anonymously** submit your "edge" I can start to get a
picture of where in the world these edges are.

## Why Edge?

Edges have been been a hot topic in the last few years and if you've not heard the term before, here's loosely what it
means.

An edge is a geographical location of a server within a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN is a network of computers,
usually owned by someone like Google, Amazon, or a popular one in the world of [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) web
development, [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/). Hosting solutions like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/),
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/hosting) (and many, more)
use these CDN's to deploy a website's static assets, E.g images, HTML, and CSS, and the closer these assets are to you,
the smaller the distance they have to travel down the phone line, and the faster a website will load.

Whilst this is great for static assets there's a problem with JavaScript. Or more specifically, Serverless Functions.
Serverless Functions in Jamstack web development are like special mini servers but because they are executable they
can't be deployed in the same way across the CDN. They can however be configured to run in different
[regions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/regions).

Serverless Functions differ to the traditional way "servers" work because Serverless Functions aren't running all the
time which can help significantly reduce operational costs. They can however, in some cases, cause problems with slower
response times owning to cold starts and / or distances between the user and the region the function is deployed.

Serverless Functions can be used to make server-side requests to other services, services like a database to retrieve
data to populate a website or application. For example, your Twitter timeline is made up of data that is stored in a
database, not static assets distributed globally on a CDN.

Databases, typically can't distribute data to hundreds or thousands of geographical locations because databases act like
a single source of truth and duplicating or replicating this data across multiple geographical locations to be nearer to
you is a very difficult thing to do.

### Regions

However, CockroachDB is one of only a few databases that is making steps in the right direction and has developed smart
technology that can manage replication of data and move it around different regions of the world, and thus closing the
gap between you and the data.

The Edge app is as attempt to map where in the world these CDN edge locations are and, and at a later date I plan to
migrate the app to use Vercel's Edge functions which will bring the Function region closer to you then, I can
cross-reference these locations with where in the world you could deploy a CockroachDB Database.

Unlike other database solutions CockroachDB is "cloud native" which means it can be deployed to multiple cloud providers
running in multiple regions. For example, with CockroachDB you could run your database on both Amazon Web Services (AWS)
and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and take advantage of each of their regions respectively. This can result in the faster
transfer of data to users. You can see on the following links where the AWS and GCP regions are, and with CockroachDB,
architects can configure their services to meet their customers where they are.

- [AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html)
- [GCP Regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones)

All of this is an attempt to solve the difficult problem of: **distance from data to you**.

The shorter the distance, the faster the data is available and the better it will be for both users and businesses
alike. This benefit scales up for giant companies like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and
[NetFlix](https://www.netflix.com/) who are both CockroachDB customers!

Of course, speed isn't the only concern. Data consistency is also a big issue, replicating data around multiple regions
comes with a risk. For high paced changes like transferring money from one bank account to another can mean, for a short
while the amount in one bank account might be different to the amount shown in another. CockroachDB's smart technology
is solving this problem too! However, speed vs consistency are somewhat at odds with one another ‚Äî but that's an
explanation I'll save for another time.

So, the next time you're watching a junk reality TV show on NetFlix, or doom scrolling on Twitter, spare a thought for
all those little Cockroaches transferring the data to you in the most efficient way possible!

### Evidence

As you can see, explaining this using only the written word is quite difficult, and its my hope that by using a **"show,
don't tell"** approach to storytelling we'll be better able to explain the complexities and business benefits to the
technical, and the not-so technical in a more engaging, informative or imaginative way.

So c'mon, give that "submit" button a click and let me see your [Edge](https://cockroachdb-edge-locations.vercel.app/).
