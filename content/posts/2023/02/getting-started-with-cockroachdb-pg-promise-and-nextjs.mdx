In this guide you should find everything you need to get started with
[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/), [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) and
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (API Routes). But, before I dive in I'd like to explain my "why".

## Getting Started Resources

[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) have a number of ways to help you get going, and depending on where you
are with you learning journey and the technology you're familiar with, you can chose where to start.

1. [Cockroach University](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/cockroach-university/)
2. [Build a Simple CRUD Node.js App with CockroachDB and the node-postgres Driver](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb.html)
3. [Deploy a Web App Built on CockroachDB with Vercel](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/deploy-app-vercel.html)

Unfortunately for me none of the above suited my needs. The sample app I've created for this guide however, does.

If you're keen to jump ahead you an see the sample app and code on the links below.

## Modern FrontEnds

You probably know this already but, in the "Jamstack", the lines between frontend and the server are somewhat blurred,
and the concept of building a web application that has a frontend and a separate node.js server are becoming a thing of
the past.

Using a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) _(there are many others)_ you can develop your frontend code
alongside your server-side code in the same project. In cases when using
[getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), you'll not only
develop your server-side code in the same project, you'll develop your server-side code in the same _page_ as your
frontend code! Both together can be deployed to a single CDN like Vercel.

Because of this shift I've written this guide to help you get started with
[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/) in the Jamstack era.

### SQL / pg-promise

I'm new to SQL. I've somehow managed to avoid learning SQL for almost 20 years but, its now time for me to knuckle down
and learn it, and for that reason I've chosen [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise).

In my opinion, pg-promise is the closest you can get to writing SQL in a node.js environment and again, just an opinion,
I find it less confusing to look at than [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/). There are JavaScript abstractions
like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) which will allow you to interact with a SQL database from a node.js environment
but, by using Prisma you'll be writing JavaScript and learning Prisma. I wanted to **write SQL** and **learn SQL**.

### cockroach sql

There's one other "tool" I think you'll want to be aware of called
[cockroach sql](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-sql.html). I've found this to be super helpful when
configuring and managing my CockroachDB Clusters and databases. I haven't been using it to **query** or **mutate** data
stored within the database... that's the bit [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) will do. cockroach sql
is good for performing configuration or management tasks, but when developing an application like this sample app, you
probably won't need to use it much.

If you don't have
[cockroach sql](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-sql-binary.html#install-cockroach-sql) installed, go
ahead and do that now.

## Getting Started With CockroachDB

Before you do anything you'll need a free CockroachDB account, go a head and
[sign up](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup) before continuing.

### Create a CockroachDB Cluster

You should be looking at a page similar to the below. Click the **Create Cluster** button.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image1} alt="Create a New Cluster" />

### Setup a CockroachDB Cluster - 1

For the purposes of this guide I'll be using CockroachDB Serverless, select **Severless** and scroll down.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image2} alt="Select Serverless Database" />

### Setup a CockroachDB Cluster - 2

CockroachDB is _cloud native_. CockroachDB can be deployed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It's not overly important at this stage of getting started to know why to chose one Cloud provider over the other but,
just for completeness, this is a super valuable feature of CockroachDB as it allows companies to avoid "vendor lock in".

You can also select which regions you'd like your database deployed to. Generally speaking you'll choose a region that
is close to your [Serverless Function](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/regions) region
and / or your users.

At present CockroachDB Serverless can only run in a single region. Multi-Region Serverless is launching soon so I'd
suggest you give [CockroachDB](https://twitter.com/CockroachDB) a follow on Twitter so you don't miss the launch.

Lastly, give your Cluster a name. **Choose wisely as this can't be changed later!**. I've been prefixing the names with
either **dev-** or **prod-** so I can more easily switch between databases whilst developing. I'll cover this later when
discussing
[Next.js environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#environment-variable-load-order).

When you're done, click the **Create your free cluster** button.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image3} alt="Selected Cloud Provider and give the database a name" />

### Create SQL User - name

My name is Paul so I created a user called Paul ü§∑. When you've entered an SQL user name click the **Generate & save
password** button, and then click the **Next** button.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image4} alt="Create or select an SQL user" />

### Create SQL User - password

This step isn't entirely required as the password can be revealed in the next step but, if you wanna be super safe, copy
the password and save it somewhere, then click the **Next** button when you're ready.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image5} alt="Copy and save the password" />

### Create SQL User - DATABASE_URL

There are a couple of options available via the various select inputs, for the purposes of this guide you can use the
options I've selected in the image below. These are:

- Database: `defaultdb`
- Select option/language: `JavasScript/TypeScript`
- Select tool: `node-postgres`
- Selection operating system: `(automatically detected)`

When you're ready you can now copy the connection string and save it somewhere safe.

‚òùÔ∏è One thing to be aware of when using the _Copy_ button üëá.

The connection string includes `export DATABASE_URL="..."`. You won't need the `export` bit. This is helpful for when
developing node.js applications and when run in a terminal will export the connection string to your terminal session,
but when you close your terminal window it'll be gone.

When using Next.js you'll be saving this variable in one of the `.env` files. More on that in moment.

Delete the word `export` and save the connection string somewhere safe. Here's a diff.

```diff
- export DATABASE_URL="..."
+ DATABASE_URL="..."
```

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image6} alt="Copy and save the connection string" />

### Repeat For Production

As mentioned, I've been prefixing the Cluster name with **dev-** or **prod-**. Repeat the above steps and create a
second Cluster that will be used in production later when you deploy your Next.js app.

### Cluster Overview

You should now be looking at a page similar to the below. You probably won't need to go back into the CockroachDB Cloud
Console but maybe bookmark the page just in case.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image7} alt="Finished configured Cluster" />

### Connecting to a Cluster with cockroach sql

It's now time to test you can connect to your CockroachDB Cluster using cockroach sql.

Open a new terminal window and type the following. Paste your connecting string in between the quote marks, and don't
forget the `;` at the end of the line. **All statements must be terminated by a semicolon**.

```
cockroach sql --url="";
```

Full example

```shell
cockroach sql --url="postgresql://paul:<ENTER-SQL-USER-PASSWORD>@dev-test-db-6335.7tc.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full";
```

If the connection was successful you should be seeing something similar to the below.

```shell
# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit, type: \q.
#
# Client version: CockroachDB CCL v22.2.4 (aarch64-apple-darwin21.2, built 2023/02/13 17:52:58, go1.19.4)
# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v22.2.5 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, built 2023/02/16 16:23:05, go1.19.4)
# Cluster ID: ddf31a83-ff79-4701-3dab-ffca12c6ea40
#
# Enter \? for a brief introduction.
#
paul@dev-test-db-6335.7tc.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb>
```

_If you wish to escape cockroach sql at any time you can type the word `exit` and hit enter._

### Creating a table with cockroach sql

At this point you will have a Cluster and a database. To double check this, run the following in your terminal.
_(assuming the cockroach sql session is still running)_

```shell
SHOW DATABASES;
```

You should be looking at something similar to the below.

```shell
  database_name | owner | primary_region | secondary_region | regions | survival_goal
----------------+-------+----------------+------------------+---------+----------------
  defaultdb     | root  | NULL           | NULL             | {}      | NULL
  postgres      | root  | NULL           | NULL             | {}      | NULL
  system        | node  | NULL           | NULL             | {}      | NULL
(3 rows)

```

However, you'll still need to create a table. You can see what I mean if you run the following in your terminal.

```shell
SHOW TABLES;
```

Which will likely result in something similar to the below.

```shell
SHOW TABLES 0
```

If you're planning to use my sample app without modification you can create a table using the schema below.

Most of the data types used are standard [SQL data types](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-data-types/) with the
exception of the `id`. Rather than using `AUTO_INCREMENT`, with CockroachDB you can use a helper function called
`gen_random_uuid`. You can read more about that in the docs here:
[UUID](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/uuid.html)

Run the following in your terminal to create a table called `locations`.

```shell
CREATE TABLE locations (
  id       UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  date     DATE,
  city     VARCHAR,
  lat      DECIMAL,
  lng      DECIMAL,
  runtime  VARCHAR
);
```

To check the table was created correctly, run the following in your terminal.

```shell
SHOW TABLES;
```

Which should result in something similar to the below.

```shell
  schema_name | table_name | type  | owner | estimated_row_count | locality
--------------+------------+-------+-------+---------------------+-----------
  public      | locations  | table | paul  |                   0 | NULL
```

üéâ Your Cluster, database and table are now ready for some [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) action.
In the next steps I'll take you through how to build the sample app using Next.js.

## Getting Started With pg-promise and Next.js

I think I'm somewhat alone in my thinking when it comes to spinning up new "framework" projects. I'm not a fan of
running a command in the terminal and _bippity boppity boo_ an application pops out. It's faster for sure, but did you
learn anything?

My approach is deeply rooted in the age old fable of the
[The Tortoise and the Hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare)... and we all know who won that
race üê¢.

### Create an Empty GitHub Repository

This is usually the first thing I'll do when starting a new Next.js project.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image8} alt="Create GitHub Repository" />

I also like to select the `.gitignore` and `license` before cloning the repository to my local development environment,
these are.

- .gitignore: `Node`
- License: `MIT License`

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image9} alt="Create GitHub Repository" />

If you're following along, you're now ready to clone the repo to you local development environment, E.g.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/cockroachdb-pg-promise-nextjs.git
```

Once you've cloned the repository you can change directory and move inside the project directory, E.g

```shell
cd cockroachdb-pg-promise-nextjs
```

If you're in the correct directory you can create a default `package.json` by running the following command.

```shell
 npm init -y
```

### Install Dependencies

There's x3 dependencies you'll need to install to use Next.js, run the following in your terminal,

```shell
npm install next react react-dom --save
```

There's also a couple more dependencies you'll need to install to build my sample application. Run the following in your
terminal.

```shell
npm install pg-promise request-ip fast-geoip --save

```

### Add Scripts

With the dependencies installed open up `package.json` and add the following to `"scripts"`. You can also see this
mentioned in the Next.js docs: [Manual Setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#manual-setup).

```diff
  "scripts": {
+    "dev": "next dev",
+    "build": "next build",
+    "start": "next start",
+    "lint": "next lint",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },

```

### Environment Variables

There's a few options in the Next.js docs for how to use environment variables here:
[Default Environment Variables ](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)

Go ahead and create the following at the root of your project.

- `.env.production.local`
- `.env.production.local`

‚òùÔ∏è Make sure you add the names of these environment variables to your `.gitignore`, somewhere around Line 80, E.g.

```diff
# Next.js build output
.next
+ .env.development.local
+ .env.production.local
```

Inside each of the `.env.` files you can add the connection string you copied earlier from the
[Create SQL User - DATABASE_URL](#create-sql-user---database_url) step.

Here's what my `.env.development.local` looks like. _(I've replaced the password with `123`)_.

```shell
# .env.development.local

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://paul:123@dev-test-db-6335.7tc.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full"
```

You may wish to repeat this process for `.env.production.local` and use the connection string from the **prod-** Cluster
if you created one in the earlier step.

### pg-promise config

I borrowed this setup from an issue on the `pg-promise` repo. You can see the issue here:
[Question re: WARNING: Creating a duplicate database object for the same connection #175](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/issues/175)

The issue relates to using `pg-promise` in instances where the connection might be invoked more than once. In this
sample app you'll be using the `getDB` function in both a server-side request using `getServerSideProps` and from within
a Serverless Function (API Routes). You only need to create the `pg-promise` database once so the following singleton
pattern prevents duplicates from being created when `getDB` is called using the different methods in this sample app.

Create a directory at the root of you project called `db`. Inside this directory create a file called `index.js` and add
the following code snippet.

```javascript
// ./db

import pgPromise from 'pg-promise';

const pgp = pgPromise();

const createSingleton = (name, create) => {
  const s = Symbol.for(name);
  let scope = global[s];
  if (!scope) {
    scope = { ...create() };
    global[s] = scope;
  }
  return scope;
};

export const getDB = () => {
  return createSingleton('my-app-db-space', () => {
    return {
      db: pgp(process.env.DATABASE_URL),
      pgp
    };
  });
};
```

### Create A Page

Create a directory at the root of your project called `pages`. Inside this directory create a file called `index.js` and
add the following code snippet.

In the steps further down you'll be using two different ways to communicate with the database. To make this a little
easier to digest I've split the functionality into two different parts.

#### Query

When "reading" data from the database you'll use `getServerSideProps`.

#### Mutation

When "inserting" date into or "deleting" data from the database you'll be using Serverless Functions called from a
client side `fetch` request.

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';

const Page = ({ data, error }) => {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <main style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui' }}>
        <h1>Error</h1>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}</pre>
      </main>
    );
  }

  return (
    <main style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui' }}>
      <h1>Getting Started With CockroachDB, pg-promise and Next.js</h1>
      <h2>Insert</h2>
      <p>Click submit to insert a new location</p>
      <button onClick={() => {}}>Submit</button>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </main>
  );
};

export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
  const { getDB } = require('../db');
  const { db } = getDB();

  try {
    const response = await db.any('SELECT * from locations');

    return {
      props: {
        data: {
          locations: response.map((res) => {
            const { id, date, city, lat, lng, runtime } = res;
            return {
              id,
              date: String(new Date(date * 1000)),
              city,
              lat,
              lng,
              runtime
            };
          })
        }
      }
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      props: {
        error: error.message
      }
    };
  }
};

export default Page;
```

There's quite a lot going on here so I'll talk you through it.

Look for `getServerSideProps`. This function runs on the server and can be used to get data from the database. The
`require` and the destructured statement for `db` are the pg-promise you setup earlier. Using `db.` you can now use the
[pg-promise methods](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise#methods) to communicate with the database.

In this page `db.any` is used within a try / catch statemetn to run a common SQL query, E.g `SELECT * from locations`
which, as you might imagine selects everything from the table called locations.

- If the response is successful it's returned by `getServerSideProps` to the page and made available via the `data`
  prop.
- If the response is unsuccessful an error is returned by `getServerSideProps` and is available to the page via the
  `error` prop.

‚òùÔ∏è If there is an `error` I return early and display the error using an HTML `<pre>` element.

üòä If there is `data` then I return as planned, and using another HTML `<pre>` element show the data retrieved from the
database.

### Serverless Function - Insert

The insert function works a little differently and is made up of two separate parts.

- Serverless Function created in `/pages/api/`.
- Client side `fetch` used inside the page.

To create the Serverless Function make a new directory in `pages` called `api`. Then inside the `api` directory create a
new file called `insert-location.js` and add the following code snippet.

```javascript
// pages/api/insert-location.js

const { getDB } = require('../../db');
const requestIp = require('request-ip');
const geoip = require('fast-geoip');

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { db } = getDB();
  const { date } = JSON.parse(req.body);

  try {
    const ip = await requestIp.getClientIp(req);
    const geo = await geoip.lookup(ip);

    const city = geo ? geo.city : 'Greenland';
    const lat = geo ? geo.ll[0] : 65.95346100241352;
    const lng = geo ? geo.ll[1] : -44.96798528799432;

    const response = await db.one(
      'INSERT INTO locations (date, city, lat, lng, runtime) VALUES(${date}, ${city}, ${lat}, ${lng}, ${serverless}) RETURNING id',
      {
        date: date,
        city: city,
        lat: lat,
        lng: lng,
        serverless: 'serverless'
      }
    );

    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'A-OK!',
      data: {
        id: response.id,
        city: city,
        date: date,
        lat: lat,
        lng: lng
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
}
```

Once again there's quite a lot going on in here so I'll talk you through it.

As before, you'll need to `require` the `getDB` function along with two of the dependencies installed earlier.
`requestIp` and `geoip` are used to convert the IP address from the `req` object into a real geographical location.
Depending on where you are in the world this will be different.

‚òùÔ∏è However, when running this on `http://localhost:3000/` there won't be an IP address so there's x3 ternary conditions
to catch `null` values. When running this locally the function will return details for Greenland.

The date is taken from the `req.body`, this ensures the date comes from the timezone of the user's browser, not the
timezone of wherever the Serverless Function has been deployed on the Vercel (AWS) network.

These geographical locations and the date are then inserted into the database using `db.one` from pg-promise, the query
itself is standard SQL syntax. The only key part I'd like to ensure you notice is where it says `RETURNING id`. This
ensures the response actually returns the `id` after the row has been inserted into the table.

Following on form that I'm using `res.status(200)` chained with `.json({})` to send the `id` and other properties that
the function created back to the client. You probably won't need these, but if you want to use a `console.log()` in the
`fetch` request, which I'll explain next you'd see what's been inserted into the database table.

### fetch - Insert

```diff
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';

const Page = ({ data, error }) => {

+  const handleInsert = async () => {
+    try {
+      const response = await fetch('/api/insert-location', {
+        method: 'POST',
+        body: JSON.stringify({
+          date: new Date(),
+        }),
+      });

+      const json = await response.json();
+      console.log(json);

+      if (!response.ok) {
+        throw new Error(json.message);
+      }
+    } catch (error) {
+      console.error(error.message);
+    }
+  };


  if (error) {
    ...
  }


  return (
    <main style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui' }}>
      <h1>Getting Started With CockroachDB, pg-promise and Next.js</h1>
      <h2>Insert</h2>
      <p>Click submit to insert a new location</p>
-     <button onClick={() => {}}>Submit</button>
+     <button onClick={handleInsert}>Submit</button>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </main>
  );
};

export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
...
};

export default Page;
```

This is a client-side HTTP fetch request with the method of `POST`. The request sends the date on the `body` ready to be
used in the Serverless Function. You can see the response in your browser because I've added `console.log(json)`. You
might want to remove this for production.

It's worth noting that you won't see the page refresh when the response comes back. If you manually refresh the page you
will see all the current rows in the locations table, but hang in there. There's a special Next.js _trick_ we can use to
refresh the page after the response comes back.

### Serverless Function - Delete

The delete function is similar to the insert function but a little simpler, it is also made up of to separate.

- Serverless Function created in `/pages/api/`.
- Client side `fetch` used inside the page.

To create the Serverless Function make a new file called `delete-location.js` inside the `api` directory and add the
following code snippet.

```javascript
// pages/api/delete-location.js

const { getDB } = require('../../db');

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { db } = getDB();
  const { id } = JSON.parse(req.body);

  try {
    await db.none('DELETE FROM locations WHERE id = $1', id);

    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'A-OK!',
      data: {
        id
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
}
```

As promised this function is simpler. This time the `id` is taken from the `req.body` and is used to delete a row from
the locations table in the database using `db.none`. There's no need to return anything using SQL this time and all I'm
doing is returning the `id` back to the client so you can add `console.log(json)` and confirm the `id` that was sent was
the `id` that was deleted.

### fetch - Delete

```diff
// pages/index.js

import React from 'react';

const Page = ({ data, error }) => {

  const handleInsert = async () => {
    ...
  };

+  const handleDelete = async (id) => {
+    try {
+      const response = await fetch('/api/delete-location', {
+        method: 'POST',
+        body: JSON.stringify({
+          id: id,
+        }),
+      });
+
+      const json = await response.json();
+      console.log(json);
+
+      if (!response.ok) {
+        throw new Error(json.message);
+      }
+
+      refreshData();
+    } catch (error) {
+      console.error(error.message);
+    }
+  };


  if (error) {
    ...
  }


  return (
    <main style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui' }}>
      <h1>Getting Started With CockroachDB, pg-promise and Next.js</h1>
      <h2>Insert</h2>
      <p>Click submit to insert a new location</p>
      <button onClick={handleInsert}>Submit</button>
      <h2>Data</h2>
-      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
+      {data.locations.map((l, i) => {
+        const { id, date, city, lat, lng, runtime } = l;
+        return (
+          <dl key={i}>
+            <dt>Id</dt>
+            <dd>
+              <span>{id}</span> <button onClick={() => handleDelete(id)}>delete</button>
+            </dd>
+            <dt>Date</dt>
+            <dd>{date}</dd>
+            <dt>City</dt>
+            <dd>{city}</dd>
+            <dt>Latitude</dt>
+            <dd>{lat}</dd>
+            <dt>Longitude</dt>
+            <dd>{lng}</dd>
+            <dt>Runtime</dt>
+            <dd>{runtime}</dd>
+          </dl>
+        );
+      })}
    </main>
  );
};

export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
 ...
};

export default Page;
```

### Final Touches

As mentioned earlier when you insert or delete the page doesn't update to show the data. Only when you manually refresh
will you notice a difference. Let's fix that!

The reason the page doesn't update is because it's Server-side rendered and doesn't know about any updates that have
happened as a result of any client-side fetch requests. To remedy this you can call a `refreshData()` after both the
insert and delete requests come back from the Serverless Function. It works like this.

```diff
// pages/index.js

import React from 'react';
+ import { useRouter } from 'next/router';


const Page = ({ data, error }) => {
+  const router = useRouter();


+  const refreshData = () => {
+    router.replace(router.asPath, undefined, { scroll: false });
+  };


  const handleInsert = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/insert-location', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          date: new Date(),
        }),
      });

      const json = await response.json();
+      refreshData();
      console.log(json);

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(json.message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error.message);
    }
  };

  const handleDelete = async (id) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/delete-location', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          id: id,
        }),
      });

      const json = await response.json();
+      refreshData();
      console.log(json);

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(json.message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error.message);
    }
  };


  if (error) {
    ....
  }


  return (
    <main style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui' }}>
      ...
    </main>
  );
};


export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
 ...
};

export default Page;

```

## Deploying to Vercel

I'm not going to walk you through this as its been really well documented in the
[Vercel docs](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs). All I'd like to mention is this. Earlier I mentioned creating
two different Clusters, one for development, one for Production. Use the production connection string when adding the
environment variable to you Vercel Project.

## Finished

This has been quite a journey and I hope you've ended up with something not to dissimilar to my sample app. If you spot
any mistakes or think there are areas that could be expanded on please feel free to leave a comment or come and find me
