## Project Overview

In Feburary 2023 I released [cloud-regions-country-flags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloud-regions-country-flags)
because I needed it! I was working on a demo applicaiton for
[CockroachDB's new Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/api/cloud/v1#overview) and wanted to show the database
regions in a more user friendly way.

## The Problem

You'll see in the docs that when you make a request using the
[/clusters](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/api/cloud/v1#get-/api/v1/clusters) endpoint it will return, among other
things, a list of regions where the database(s) is/are running. E.g

```json
[
  {
    "name": "clever-phantom",
    "cockroach_version": "v22.2.3",
    "plan": "SERVERLESS",
    "cloud_provider": "AWS",
    "regions": [
      {
        "name": "eu-west-1"
        ...
      }
    ]
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "mellow-stork",
    "cockroach_version": "v22.2.3",
    "plan": "SERVERLESS",
    "cloud_provider": "GCP",
    "regions": [
      {
        "name": "use-east-1"
        ...
      }
    ]
    ...
  }
]
```

Using this payload I displayed a fancy looking "card" which shows the name, plan, version of CockroachDB and the regions
the cluster was running in. As you can see from the above, `eu-west-1` isn't an overly attractive thing to show in a UI.

My requirement was to map this region name to a country flag. Shouldn't be too hard I thought, someone has probably
published an npm package that can do this â€” I was wrong.

Turns out there's absolutely loads of database regions, and their names aren't statndardised between providers. For
instance Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) use different names for similar locations.

## The Solution

I Googled around for a little while and with no easy solution in sight I spun up this little project and et voilÃ ,
lovely little flag emojis in my UI!

You can find the package on npm here:
[cloud-regions-country-flags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloud-regions-country-flags), and here's how it works.

```javascript
import { getInfo } from 'cloud-regions-country-flags';

getInfo('eu-west-1', 'AWS');

// => { location: 'Europe (Ireland)', flag: 'ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª' }
```

With the package installed I can now pass the `region.name` and `cloud_provider` from the Cloud API response as
parameters to the `getInfo` function which returns the appropriate country flag, E.g

```javascript
import { getInfo } from 'cloud-regions-country-flags';

const response = ...

response.regions.map((region, index) => {
  const { name } = region
  return <span key={index}>{getInfo(name, response.cloud_provider).flag}</span>
}))

// => <span>ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª</span>

```

I'm not sure how many folks out there will ever need this, I did, so I made it. ğŸ•º
