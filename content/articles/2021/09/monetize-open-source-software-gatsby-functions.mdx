[Gatsby Serverless Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/) provide front-end developers a way to

interest to you and your site isn't built using Gatsby, this approach may well be the answer you were looking for.

Along with writing the article I also created this motion graphics video.
