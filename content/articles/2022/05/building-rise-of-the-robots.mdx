Iâ€™d like to Introduce [Rise of the Robots](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/demos/rise-of-the-robots/). ðŸ¤– A Gatsby + Rive +
Contentful powered creative, performant, and accessible demo.

Along with designing and building the demo, speaking at the live event and webinar, and writing the article, I also
created this motion graphics video.
