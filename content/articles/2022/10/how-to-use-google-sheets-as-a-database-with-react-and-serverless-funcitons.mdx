In this tutorial I'll be explaining how to use Google Sheets as a database, to store the results of a user poll. I've
used this Google Sheets approach for a number of marketing campaigns. I chose this method over a more traditional
Database solution for one reason: Data retrieval.

It does of course entirely depend on your requirements, but having the ability to simply share a Google Sheet with a
technical or non-technical member of my team — so they can easily see captured data — has, on more than one occasion,
proved really valuable.
