Ansible is well known it the IT operations fields with its fantastic automation abilities. You can do whatever you want
with Windows too if it's a Powershell, bat script or one of the more than the hundreds modules. I will use it to
configure my personal machine and save the hustle every time I step on new one. It's not a big deal to install a few
programs but I'm sure this will repay in the long term. Can be pretty useful for configuring multiple machines too.
Using Ansible to target localhost on Linux is like click-click-go, but It's different when it's comes to Windows. We
need to install WSL on Windows, Ansible on WSL, Enable WinRm on Windows and finally control it from WSL. And all this
happens on your localhost.

# Install Ansible on WSL

From within PowerShell run the following commands. Enable WSL:
`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`

Install Ubuntu distribution but you may choose to install whatever distro you want:
`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1604 -OutFile Ubuntu.appx -UseBasicParsing`

Start your WSL and update packages: `sudo apt-get update`

Install Ansible:

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

Install packages for WinRM support:

```
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install pywinrm
sudo pip install xmltodict
```

# Enable WinRM

By default WinRM works only for Private or Domain networks. You can skip that by providing parameter to
`Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck` but I don't suggest doing that. Instead make your trusted network private.
Then enable WinRM: `Enable-PSRemoting` running it in Powershell.

Enable Basic Auth: `Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\Basic -Value $true`

Enable Unencrypted connection: `Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Service\AllowUnencrypted -Value $true`

# Run the playbook

Using `ansible-pull` run the playbook which install Chocolatey and a few packages from it. Full details can found in the
[repo](https://github.com/gmarokov/ansible-win-postinstall). Provide your username and password for your Windows
machine.

`ansible-pull â€“U https://github.com/gmarokov/ansible-win-postinstall.git -e ansible-user=your_win_user ansible_password=your_win_user_password`

# Conclusion

I'm sure you as developer make a lot of tweaks to your os, me too. Having a few more tweaks to add, would be great to
share some ideas and extend it even further. I also created a playbooks for
[Ubuntu](https://github.com/gmarokov/ansible-playbook-postinstall-ubuntu) and
[Fedora](https://github.com/gmarokov/ansible-playbook-postinstall-fedora), check them out if you are using one of this
distros.
