If Bootstrap is great for user interfaces, well, Semantic UI is briliant. For React developers, there isÂ library
available offering already backed Semantic UI components. I decided to give it a try and spin it on the

<a href="https://github.com/bradymholt/aspnet-core-react-template">template</a> Brady created which uses Bootstrap. The result?
Less and more readable codebase. In addition I wrote only 1 line of CSS. Curious already? Get the fork from
<a href="https://github.com/gmarokov/aspnet-core-react-template">here</a>.

The library is still in version under 1 (in the moment of writting 0.79), but has 100% components coverage from the
originator <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>. You can check out the library
