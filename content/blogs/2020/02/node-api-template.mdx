# Why

Have you recently started a new Node.js API project? Did you use some template or started the project from scratch? I
was asking the same questions myself and I was looking for minimal boilerplate for a while. There were so many options
that it was hard to pick one. Most of them are using Express.js, others are using ES5 or lack test setup. So I decided
to spin one on my own and reuse it in the future. Here is
[the repo at GitHub](https://github.com/gmarokov/node-fastify-mongo-api).

# How

My setup has the following characteristics:

## API

- Node version 10 or later
- TypeScript for obvious reasons
- Fastify for its asynchronous nature and being faster than Express or Restify
- Nodemon in development for watching for changes and restart the server

## Data

- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Docker for MongoDB service

## Tests

- Jest for being the de facto in Node testing
- In memory Mongod server for easily mock the DB
- Coverall for coverage collector after Jest report is generated

## Code formatting and static analysis

- ESLint config
- Prettier config attached to the linter
- Editor config

## Documentation

- Swagger UI for API documentation
- Postman collections attached from testing the endpoints

## CI

- Continuous integration in Travis CI. Steps:

1. Install dependencies
2. Run tests
3. Collect coverage and pass it to Coverall
