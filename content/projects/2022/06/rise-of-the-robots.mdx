## Project Overview

From April 2022 to June 2022 I designed and built
[Rise of the Robots](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/demos/rise-of-the-robots/). The motivation for this project, was the past.
I used to be a Flash Designer and back in the glory days of Web Development I made some pretty cool stuff.

When I switched to JavaScript / React Development, life got dull. Rise of the Robots is a resurrection of the past, but
using new tools that fill the void Flash created when Apple killed it circa 2010. I worked in collabortaion with
[Rive](https://rive.app/) to demonstrate what's now possible using modern day animation techniques and Jamstack
technologies, all the while being careful to not tank Lighthouse scores and ensuring accessibility remained top of mind.

## Deliverables

Along with the branding and site design, and build I documented my journey on the
[Gatsby Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/building-rise-of-the-robots), presented at Gatsby's first in-person event
since COVID at the offices of [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) in San Francisco, wrote a guest article for the
[Contentful Blog](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2022/07/05/building-rise-of-the-robots-with-gatsby-and-contentful/)
and co-hosted a [webinar](/streams/2022/06/achieving-performant-creativity-with-gatsby-and-rive/) with Rive founder
[Guido Rosso](https://twitter.com/guidorosso).

### Bonus Deliverable

The project has been featured on [Contentful's Developer Showcase](https://www.contentful.com/developers/showcase/), oh,
and I also knocked up this rather epic trailer to promote the in-person event using After Effects skills I haven't used
in a very long time!
