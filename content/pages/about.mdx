# More About Me

Hey there! 👋

I'm Paul and a long long time ago I was a designer, but after a few years of pixel pushing I realized code is just
better. I've held various positions in and around advertising, tech and web/application development in both permanent
and contract positions since 2005.

I once co-founded and ran an award winning digital production agency in London called
[Super natural](https://vimeo.com/109836047)

I now work at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) 💜

## Then

Back in 2005 after graduating Leeds Metropolitan University with 1st Class honours in MultiMedia technology I got my
first job for a little design and development studio called ward404.

Our main projects were building eCards for record labels such as EMI, Warner and Virgin Records, we'd take album artwork
and design and build Flash micro-sites to help promote album or single sales. These micro-sites would typically involve
an intro animation and showcase a 30 second video trailer and an audio preview player.

A little while later Rich Media burst on to the scene so we transferred all of our learnings from micro-sites over to
Rich Media advertisements.

This shift in design and development landed me a job in advertising and I worked for Play (M&C Saatchi) from 2008 where
I continued to design and develop Flash Rich Media campaigns and picked up multiple awards for my work... including a
[D&AD](https://www.dandad.org/awards/professional/2010/graphic-design/17943/one-in-seven/) for an interactive _out of
home_ sound driven animation to promote [RNID](https://rnid.org.uk/). During this period I received a promotion and
managed my first team of two.

After a couple of years at Play, in 2010, I went freelance and worked at various London creative agencies including CHI
& Partners, RKCRY&R and BBH to name a few. I then started a contract with TBMWA (MAL) which is Apple's creative
agency... naturally they couldn't use Flash for their online campaigns so we developed HTML / JavaScript and later CSS
animation libraries and methods to bring animation to the iPhone.

In 2012 spotting a gap in the market for HTML Rich Media campaigns I started Super natural from kitchen. Six months in
and i was snowed under with work so teamed up with ex-play colleague Jon Bezalel. Together we grew the company from a
team of two, to a team of ten and continued to work with top London creative agencies and clients including Channel 4's
4Creative, ITV Creative, Netflix and adam&eve among others.

We developed engaging and delightful online campaigns and micro-sites, and picked up a few awards along the way
including a **BAFTA** for our
[Digital Creativity](http://www.bafta.org/sites/default/files/uploads/baftatvcraft1516winnerslist.pdf) work on Channel
4's Humans.

During this time I was a hands on designer, developer and oversaw all creative and technical output, trained and
mentored members of the creative teams and engaged with clients to develop creative ideas.

In 2016 I felt the time was right to move on and with the rise of JavaScript frameworks I decided to take a leap into
React application development.

## Now

For many years I contracted as a Component Library and Design System specialist, my love of Design transferred well from
my creative past into modern day web application development (where everything looks like Material Design), and my
background in Flash / ActionScript meant adopting modern JavaScript was a breeze.

In 2018 I discovered [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and immediately fell in love with the developer experience and
feel it's a brilliant middle ground between using a framework like React and brining back some of that internet joy we
lost when websites became _web applications_

I'm pretty active in Open-source and everything I've done can be found on my GitHub:
[https://github.com/PaulieScanlon](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon)

From 2020 onwards I've become increasingly interested in technical writing and have had multiple articles published on
well known sites and blogs such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/contributors/paul-scanlon),
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/07/16/add-playful-animated-svg-reactions-to-a-gatsby-blog/) and
[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/roll-your-own-comments-with-gatsby-and-faunadb/)

My work at Gatsby combines my love of creativity from the past and fuses it with technology from the present to create
hard hitting, educational, promotional and as some say _sensational_ product demos which drive product adoption and
growth.

I'm a huge fan of process and have worked with some really great developers in some very well organized engineering
teams. For balance, I've also worked on teams that weren't so organized — but I still get the job done!
