<h1 className="!mb-0">Paul Scanlon</h1>

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul and a long long time ago I was a designer, but after a few years of pixel pushing I realized code is just
better. I've held various positions in and around advertising, tech and web/application development in both full time,
and contract positions since 2005.

I once co-founded and ran an award winning digital production agency based in London called
[Super natural](https://vimeo.com/109836047). I started the company from my kitchen and grew it to a team of 10. From
2012 to 2016 I was hands-on designer/developer, and Technical Director / CTO.
