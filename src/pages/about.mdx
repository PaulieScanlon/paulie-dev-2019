## [my story](#my-story)

### [then](then)

Back in 2005 after graduating Leeds Metropolitan University with 1st Class honours in MultiMedia technology i got my first job for a little design / development studio called ward404.

Our main projects were building eCards for record lables such as EMI, Warner and Virgin Records, we'd take album artwork and design and build Flash micro-sites to help promote album or single sales. These micro-sites would typically involve an intro animation hook and showcase the 30 second trailer and an audio preview player.

A little while later the rise of Rich Media burst on to the scene so we transferred all of our learnings from eCards over to Rich Media advertisements.

This shift in design and development landed me a job in advertising and i worked for Play (M&C Saatchi) where i continued to design and develop Flash Rich Media campaigns and picked up multiple awards for my work... including a D&AD for an interactive _out of home_ sound driven animation to promote RNID.

After a couple of years at Play i went freelance and worked at various London creative agencies including CHI & Partners, RKCRY&R and BBH to name a few. I then landed a contract with TBMWA (MAL) which is Apple's creative agency...naturally they couldn't use Flash for their online campaigns so we developed HTML / JavaScript and later CSS methods to bring animation to the iPhone.

Spotting a gap in the market for HTML Rich Media campaigns in 2012 I co-founded and ran **award** winning digital production agency Super natural, we grew from a team of two to a team of ten and continued to work with top London creative agencies and clients including Channel 4's 4Creative, ITV Creative, Netflix and adam&eve among others. We developed engaging and delightful online campaigns and micro-sites, and picked up a few awards along the way including a **BAFTA** for our work with Channel 4's Humans.
During this time i oversaw all creative and technical output and engaged with clients to develop creative ideas.

In 2016 i felt the time was right to move on and with the rise of JavaScript frameworks decided to take a leap into React application development.

Since then Iâ€™ve been contracting and love React, user interface development and data visualisation. I have good JavaScript knowledge but wouldn't class myself as a hardcore JavaScript engineer. I do believe in excellent code quality but given my background i also understand UX and deeply care about how the final product looks and feels, a quality that was not overlooked at contracts i had with The Guardian and The Sun.

My primary focus over the last few years has been building custom React Component Libraries using Storybook and StyledComponents but sadly in React application land so much of my work is for internal client tools and can't be shared due to bureaucracy ðŸ˜‰

In 2019 i discovered Gatsby.js and immediately fell in love with the developer experience and feel it's a brilliant middle ground between using a framework like React but brining back some of that internet joy we lost when websites became _web applications_

I've been actively developing multiple Gatsby.js themes and plugins, all of which are opensource and can be seen on GitHub: [https://github.com/PaulieScanlon](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon)

Iâ€™m a huge fan of process and have worked with some great developers in some very well organised engineering teams. Iâ€™m familiar with and enjoy agile working processes but,
