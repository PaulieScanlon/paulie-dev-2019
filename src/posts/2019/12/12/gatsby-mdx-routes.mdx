This little plugin was as a result of seeing this tweet

<Tweet tweetLink="FezVrasta/status/1205904176171147268" />

where Federico Zivolo was asking how to create a menu for `.mdx` files used in a project.

## [demo ðŸšŒ](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-routes)

This is quite an easy thing to do if you're understand how [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem) works but if you're coming to Gatsby for the first time and you're aim is to just get up and running it can be a bit confusing when you swtich from `.js` to `.mdx`

This little plugin aims to provide a quick way to query your file system and return the slugs and navigation labels of your `.mdx` files

To use it i recommend popping it in the defaultLayout file defined by `gatsby-plugin-mdx`

```javascript
// defaultLayout.js
import React, { Fragment } from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

import { MdxRoutes } from "@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-routes"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Fragment>
    <nav>
      <MdxRoutes>
        {(routes) => (
          <ul>
            {routes.map((route, index) => (
              <li key={index}>
                <Link to={route.slug}>{route.navigationLabel}</Link>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        )}
      </MdxRoutes>
    </nav>
    <main>{children}</main>
  </Fragment>
)
```

`MdxRoutes` returns it's children and sends back data for the `slug` and a `navigationLabel` which you define in the frontmatter of each of you `.mdx` files

```javascript
---
navigationLabel: Page Title
---
```
