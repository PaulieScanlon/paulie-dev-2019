Boom! after months of work my theme is actually live! If you like data viz and want a blog that's a little bit different
to the usual kinda thing then this one's for you!

## [demo 🤷‍♂️](https://gatsby-theme-gatstats.netlify.com/)

I plan to keep [gatsby-theme-gatstats](https://gatsby-theme-gatstats.netlify.com/) in the patch versions `0.0.x` for the
time being as i've still got lots of enhancements to make and luckily there are folks out there using it and making
really good suggestions on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-theme-gatstats/issues)

This is the first theme i've created and i really loved the experience. I've been working with React for a good few
years now and in my commercial life i build component libraries so it was nice to pull all that together to create a
site that looked good as well as being SEO performant and i really made an effort to make it accessible too!
