import { DonutChart } from "../../../components/DonutChart"

Let's back track for just a second... What is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)?

To quote the creators;

> MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, like interactive charts or notifications, and export metadata. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

To put that into context i've imported and used a React component in this post like this üëá

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import { DonutChart } from "../../../components/DonutChart"

<DonutChart
  title="Average word count"
  dimension="words"
  config={{ year: 0, color: "primary" }}
/>
```

And thanks to MDX the React component magically renders. Like this üëá

<DonutChart
  title="Average word count"
  dimension="words"
  config={{ year: 0, color: "primary" }}
/>

<Divider />

The one snag, and it's a tiny drawback is that to use React components in MDX you have to import them. This is fine for one off components but for common components adding an `import` to every post is a hassle. Fortunately using the `MDXProvider` you can provide your blog with a kind of "global" way to handle components without needing to import them every time you want to use them... which is very handy indeed. üòä

Setting up a "global" method is fine if you're adding your own components but it's a lot more work to do this if you want to "embed" media content from providers like Twitter, YouTube and Instagram

## [Gatsby MDX Embed](#gatsby-mdx-embed)

Luckily for you i've created [gatsby-mdx-embed](https://gatsby-mdx-embed.netlify.com/)

[gatsby-mdx-embed](https://gatsby-mdx-embed.netlify.com/) works by wrapping the root element of your site or blog with a custom `MdxProvider` which makes it possible for embed codes like this üëá

```javascript
<Tweet tweetLink="PaulieScanlon/status/1232993668690259968" />
```

<Divider />

To be automatically rendered. Like this üëá

<Tweet tweetLink="PaulieScanlon/status/1232993668690259968" />

A lof of media providers e.g YouTube make embed-able iframe embed codes which i've turned in to custom components specifically designed to work with Gatsby and MDX.

These media provider embed codes usually require you to add some kind of `JavaScript` to your page which can be really tricky to set up, but with this plugin all you need to do is [install](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed#-getting-started) it...

```sh
npm install @pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed --save

```

<Divider />

... and then add it to `gatsby-config.js` and you're good to go.

```javascript
// gatsby.config.js

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [`@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed`]
  ...
}
```

<Divider />

## [There's more](#theres-more)

An extra trick i've used is to search the DOM for short codes that will require the provider scripts and if they aren't found the provider scripts aren't injected.

So if you're not using embedded Tweets the Twitter provider script won't be injected... keeping your site blazing fast ‚ö°

There's currently 22 components to choose from and more are on the way so head on over to [gatsby-mdx-embed](https://gatsby-mdx-embed.netlify.app/) and if you can please do give it a star ‚≠ê on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed)

<Image src={props.embedded.image1.url} />

This plugin was inspired by [gatsby-remark-oembed](https://github.com/raae/gatsby-remark-oembed) which similarly provides an easy way to embed media from providers like YouTube, Twitter, etc into your blog **without import**. However this plugin only works with markdown.
