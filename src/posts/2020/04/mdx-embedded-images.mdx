In this post i'm going to show you how to use MDXRenderer to display embedded images in the body of your MDX by sourcing them from `frontmatter`.

This approach differs from the more common approach of adding a "featured image" ... and here's why ðŸ‘‡

- A **featured image** is usually baked in to the layout component in JavaScript and always appears in the same position on the page in every post.
- An **embedded image** can be positioned _anywhere_ throughout the body of the MDX giving you more flexibility and control overs images on a post by post basis.

Whilst you can achieve something similar using an `<img />` tag and absolute or relative URLs this method will process the images using `gatsby-image`, `gatsby-plugin-sharp` and `gatsby-transformer-sharp` to keep your blog blazing fast! âš¡

Since there's so many ways a Gatsby project could be setup rather than explaining what should go in what "file" i'll be focusing on explaining the concept. If you need a little more guidance i've made a bare bones repo which you can see on GitHub [PaulieScanlon/mdx-embedded-images](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embedded-images) and most things i'll be explaining in this post can be seen in the [post-layout.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embedded-images/blob/master/src/layouts/post-layout.js) file

<Divider />

Before we start just check you have the following dependencies installed to process the images.

<Divider />

```sh
yarn add gatsby-image gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-transformer-sharp
```

<Divider />

And make sure you add the following to `gatsby-config.js`

<Divider />

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // the rest of your plugins
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
  ],
}
```

<Divider />

Ok let's start with `frontmatter`, you'll probably have a title already so add one more field below it called `embeddedImages`

EmbeddedImages is a list of files you'd like to access from anywhere in the MDX body.

<Divider />

```javascript
// test-post.mdx

---
title: Lovely stuff!
embeddedImages:
- image1.jpg
- image2.jpg
---
```

<Divider />

The images referenced in this example sit in the same directory as the `.mdx` file but you could source them from anywhere.

_If your directory structure differs from the below code snippet your GraphQL query will be different to the one i reference later in the post_

You can see the bare bones repo directory structure here: [PaulieScanlon/mdx-embedded-images/tree/master/src/posts](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embedded-images/tree/master/src/posts)

<Divider />

```javascript
| -- src
  | -- posts
    | -- test-post.mdx
    | -- image1.jpg
    | -- image2.jpg

```

<Divider />

Now we need to amend the GraphQL query that handles getting the title from `frontmatter` by
adding an `embeddedImages` query with a child `childImageSharp` query, _you can use `original` or `fluid` or anything `childImageSharp` supports._ I've also added an image quality of 90% for good measure.

<Divider />

```javascript
// post-layout.js

frontmatter {
  title
  embeddedImages {
    childImageSharp {
      original {
        width
        height
        src
      }
      fluid(quality: 90) {
        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
      }

    }
  }
}
```

<Divider />

Next we need to make sure we can access this data in Javascript. Typically you'll have a `data` prop in the layout component where you're accessing `frontmatter` so add the `embeddedImages` field to that so we can use it later

<Divider />

```javascript
// post-layout.js

data: {
  mdx: {
    body,
    frontmatter: { title, embeddedImages }
  },
}
```

<Divider />

Next we need to add a prop to the `MDXRenderer`, call it `embeddedImages`

<Divider />

```javascript
<MDXRenderer embeddedImages={}>{body}</MDXRenderer>
```

<Divider />

Now it's time for some Functional Programming! ðŸ˜Ž

We're going to take the data from the `embeddedImages` frontmatter and [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) it in to something more usable.

If you're a bit lost at this point here's the [post-layout.js](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embedded-images/blob/master/src/layouts/post-layout.js) for reference

<Divider />

```javascript
// post-layout.js

const IMAGE_KEY = "image"

const embeddedImagesByKey =
  embeddedImages &&
  embeddedImages.reduce((images, image, index) => {
    images[`${IMAGE_KEY}${index + 1}`] = images[`${IMAGE_KEY}${index + 1}`] || {
      ...image.childImageSharp,
    }
    return images
  }, {})
```

<Divider />

We should end up with the following object.

For brevity i've removed parts of the image values but you can see that for each image found in `embeddedImages` we create a new key in the **embeddedImagesByKey** object called "image", plus a number e.g "image1". Within each key is the result of spreading `...childImageSharp` which contains data for `original` and `fluid`, which are the fields we queried earlier in GraphQL... phew ðŸ˜“

<Divider />

```javascript
{
  "image1": {
    "original": {
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360,
      "src": "..."
    },
    "fluid": {
      "base64": "...",
      "aspectRatio": 16:9,
      "src": "...",
      "srcSet": "...",
      "sizes": "..."
    }
  },
  "image2": {
    "original": {
      "width": 640,
      "height": 460,
      "src": "..."
    },
    "fluid": {
      "base64": "...",
      "aspectRatio": 16:9,
      "src": "...",
      "srcSet": "...",
      "sizes": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

<Divider />

Now we need to pass the **embeddedImagesByKey** object on to the MDXRenderer.

<Divider />

```javascript
// post-layout.js

<MDXRenderer embeddedImages={embeddedImagesByKey}>{body}</MDXRenderer>
```

<Divider />

With this all sorted we will have a prop called `embeddedImages` available in the body of our MDX ðŸŽ‰

To test this is working correctly use `JSON.stringyify` to render the result of **embeddedImages** in a `<pre>` and `<code>` tag in the `.mdx` file where you added `embeddedImages` to frontmatter

<Divider />

```javascript
// test-post.mdx

<pre>
  <code>{JSON.stringify(props.embeddedImages, null, 2)}</code>
</pre>
```

<Divider />

We're nearly there!

I like to use [@theme-ui/components](https://theme-ui.com/components/link/) in all of my Gatsby projects and an easy way to give MDX access to these components is to pass them to the MDXProvider

And to take advantage of `gatsby-image` we can also pass the `<Img />` component on to the MDXProvider

<Divider />

```javascript
// post-layout.js

import * as ThemeUIComponents from "@theme-ui/components"
import Img from 'gatsby-image'

const components = {
  ...ThemeUIComponents,
  Img
}

<MDXProvider components={components}>
  <MDXRenderer embeddedImages={embeddedImagesByKey}>{body}</MDXRenderer>
</MDXProvider>
```

<Divider />

Now that you have Theme UI components available in your MDX you can use the `<Flex>` and `<Box>` components to create more interesting layouts without having to import them first.

In this example we'll position two images side by side on "desktop" and stack them on top of one another on "mobile"

There's more information about breakpoints in the Theme UI [docs](https://theme-ui.com/theming#breakpoints) but in short `width` can accept an array of values and each corresponds to a breakpoint defined in Theme UI. We're just using two here but there are four available by default.

We're also going to use the `fluid` prop on the `<Img />` component and pass it the `fluid` data from **props.embeddedImages.image(n).fluid**

<Divider />

```javascript
<Flex sx={{ flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <Box sx={{ width: ["100%", "50%"] }}>
    <Img fluid={props.embeddedImages.image1.fluid} />
  </Box>
  <Box sx={{ width: ["100%", "50%"] }}>
    <Img fluid={props.embeddedImages.image2.fluid} />
  </Box>
</Flex>
```

<Divider />

et voilÃ ! now you can display embedded images defined in `frontmatter` anywhere in your MDX. ðŸ˜Ž

<Img fluid={props.embedded.image1.fluid} />
