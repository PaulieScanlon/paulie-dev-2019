Oh hey there! 👋

Here's a byte-size round up of projects I've Open-sourced, posts and articles I've written and contracts I've completed so far this year.

<Divider />

## 1. SSR and JAMStack for the win!

Gatsby recently announced <Link href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-22-announcing-incremental-builds/" target="_blank">incremental builds</Link> and mono repo support so to put Gatsby Cloud through it's paces I created a multi-site, multi-brand mono repo + Shopify demo application and accompanying article for Gatsby. The demo application uses `gatsby-source-shopify` to source Shopify data at build time and lets Gatsby Cloud handle the re-build via a Webhook. It is as you'd imagine still blazing fast ⚡

## 2. Add Playful Animated SVG Reactions to a Gatsby Blog

I recently Open-sourced <Link href="https://react-svg-bubble-slider.netlify.app/" target="_blank">react-svg-bubble-slider</Link> to provide a fun way to add reactions to Gatsby blog posts. It was one of the most difficult UI components I've ever created! A lot of effort went into making it fully keyboard accessible and joy of joys Jason Lengstorf at Netlify helped promote it by publishing an article I wrote on the Netlify blog 😊

## 3. A Zero Component Theme for Developers

I released <Link href="https://gatsby-theme-terminal.netlify.app/" target="_blank">
gatsby-theme-terminal</Link> in early 2020, it was my second experiment with Gatsby themes and attempts
to provide a fully theme-able component library... which zero components. Yeah,
I know, get your head around that one! I feel this is an advanced approach to
building themes and interest in the project has been steadily growing and it's
recently exceed 180 stars on GitHub 🎉

## 4. Full Stack Gatsby App

I hear a lot of things about Gatsby being a tool to build blogs but it can also create full stack React applications. As a fan of Theme UI and being aware the barrier to entry can be quite high if you're coming for CSS 🤢 I deiced to create Skin UI, a CSS-in-Js Theme UI editor which allows you to create, edit, save and share themes all from the browser! 💥 I don't claim to be a designer but I'm rather proud of this one!

## 5. First commercial Gatsby build

I have to be honest, I did struggle to blog every day for 100 days during the <Link href="https://paulie.dev/posts/2020/01/100DaysOfGatsby/" target="_blank">100 Days Of Gatsby</Link> challenge but my constant Tweets and posts did catch the attention of the lead developer at Manscaped who got in touch and I was hired to help re-build manscaped.com _(new site not live yet)_. It was great to finally use Gatsby and Theme UI in a commercial project and while the world was on lockdown I was crafting beautiful UI's to increase sales of products to help men groom their testicles 😲

## 6. Successful Open-source

I've released a lot of Open-source projects this year, to some extent I'm almost drowning in them but <Link href='https://gatsby-mdx-embed.netlify.app/' target="_blank">gatsby-mdx-embed</Link> has really made it worth it. It's been adopted by a number of high profile users in the community, has received praise from number of Gatsby employees and once even earned me £9 on Ko-fi 🤑

## 7. First article officially published

As mentioned above I blogged every day for 100 days, that's over 27'000 words for the <Link href="https://paulie.dev/posts/2020/01/100DaysOfGatsby/" target="_blank">100 Days Of Gatsby</Link> challenge and it was really brills to receive recognition by the Gatsby team who reached out and asked me to write up a "round up" article !

## 8. Published on CSS-Tricks

After the highs of writing for Gatsby I took on a second article, this time for Fauna. It was supposed to be a simple post about using GraphQL and Netlify functions but turned in to something much more complex. To demonstrate how it works I created a full stack <Link href="https://fauna-gatsby-comments.netlify.app/" target="_blank">demo application</Link> to accompany the post with user authentication, a moderation queue and commenting system. Fauna liked it so much they used their sponsored account to post it on CSS-Tricks 🕺

## 9. Part of the CLI

As a Gatsby enthusiast as soon as Recipes launched I got stuck in and as much as I love Storybook and use it in all my personal and commercial projects (how else would you develop weapons grade UI's 🤷‍♂️) it is a bit tricky to configure with Gatsby.

I've open-sourced two <Link href="https://paulie.dev/posts/2020/05/gatsby-cli-recipes/" target="_blank">Recipes</Link> to solve the problems you'll face when using Storybook with JavaScript and TypeScript and both have made it in to the official Gatsby CLI 💯. I also created another article for Gatsby discussing what Recipes are, how you can write your own and some musings I had about future workflows.
