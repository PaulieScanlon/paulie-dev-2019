After seeing the following Tweet by [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) inviting users to take part in the
[Write With Fauna](https://fauna.com/blog/write-with-fauna-calling-all-Jamstack-enthusiasts) challenge i decided i'd
submit a proposal post topic.

<Tweet tweetLink="fauna/status/1247796436277719041" />

For those not in the know Fauna is a backend database solution... and it's so awesome! I'm very much the _Front End_ of
Front End development and usually don't care for backend services, that's usually something for the mega dweebs to on.
😲

but...

After i read the Fauna docs i was amazed at how simple it was to understand. I believe it's the perfect compliment for
the Jamstack movement and when thinking about how to demonstrate it's potential i focussed on how to combine Fauna with
a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) blog.

The post contains details of how to create a full stack Gatsby application and how to setup Fauna to act as a way to
store and retrieve comments made by users on your blog posts.

Fauna agreed it would indeed make for an interesting post but after i submitted my first draft it was suggested that the
post really ought to be published somewhere with a larger reach.

On May 21 2020 Fauna published my post to
[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/roll-your-own-comments-with-gatsby-and-Fauna/). This is huge win for me as i've only
been writing technical content for a short while.
