After seeing the following Tweet by [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) inviting users to take part in the [Write With Fauna](https://fauna.com/blog/write-with-fauna-calling-all-jamstack-enthusiasts) challenge i decided i'd submit a proposal post topic.

<Tweet tweetLink="fauna/status/1247796436277719041" />

For those not in the know FaunaDB is a backend database solution... and it's so awesome!
I'm very much the _Front End_ of Front End development and usually don't care for backend services, that's usually something for the mega dweebs to on. üò≤

but...

After i read the FaunaDB docs i was amazed at how simple it was to understand. I believe it's the perfect compliment for the JAMStack movement and when thinking about how to demonstrate it's potential i focussed on how to combine FaunaDB with a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) blog.

The post contains details of how to create a full stack Gatsby application and how to setup FaunaDB to act as a way to store and retrieve comments made by users on your blog posts.

FaunaDB agreed it would indeed make for an interesting post but after i submitted my first draft it was suggested that the post really ought to be published somewhere with a larger reach.

On May 21 2020 FaunaDB published my post to [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/roll-your-own-comments-with-gatsby-and-faunadb/). This is huge win for me as i've only been writing technical content for a short while.

If you'd like to read the full post you can find it [here](https://css-tricks.com/roll-your-own-comments-with-gatsby-and-faunadb/)

Oh and here's the demo application: [https://fauna-gatsby-comments.netlify.app/](https://fauna-gatsby-comments.netlify.app/)
