Well hey there ðŸ‘‹ in this blog post I'm going to discuss how to add user reactions to your Gatsby blogs posts using a fun React UI component that I've recently open-sourced, It's called [react-svg-bubble-slider](https://react-svg-bubble-slider.netlify.app/) and looks like this ðŸ‘‡

## Demo

If you're a keen bean and would like to see a fully finished demo blog I've created an example of how [react-svg-bubble-slider](https://react-svg-bubble-slider.netlify.app/) could be used to add reactions to a Gatsby blog using [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) for the back-end, Netlify functions and apollo/graphql to handle the data requests.

## Why Reactions?

You're probably familiar with reactions from social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram et al., but I rarely see reactions in blog posts. A common approach in blogs is to [implement comments](https://css-tricks.com/roll-your-own-comments-with-gatsby-and-faunadb/), but there are additional complications involved when allowing users to write whatever they want and post it to your back-end.

When you expose an input, you're giving the reader the opportunity to write _anything_ â€” and it's only a matter of time before someone writes something rude. You probably don't want your blog posts peppered with expletives, so you need to add moderation so an admin needs to approve or delete comments **before** they appear on your blog.

In addition to extra technical overhead, setting up a moderation queue also means you have to periodically log in, review comments left by readers, and approve or delete them.

Adding reactions removes all of this as you're only allowing readers to submit one of a given set of pre-approved reactions... nothing rude here, just the usual emotions one might feel after reading a post.

When I started to think about reactions I was struggling to think of a fun and original way to present the options to the reader. I toyed around with the "heart", "thumbs up" / "thumbs down" approach for a while but wasn't really excited by it, until I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ChrisGannon/status/1261209022662918144) by [Chris Gannon](https://twitter.com/ChrisGannon).

As soon as I saw Chris's SVG Bubble Slider, I knew it would make a perfect way to expose a pre-defined set of reactions to allow readers to leave their reactions on a blog post.

I explained the idea to Chris and he was on board. However this can _only_ be used on free projects. If you want to use it for a commercial project, youâ€™ll need to talk to Chris about a license.

This post will broadly explain the steps required to add [react-svg-bubble-slider](https://react-svg-bubble-slider.netlify.app/) to a Gatsby blog, but you could similarly add this to any React application.

## Get Started

To get started, install the package via `npm` (or `yarn`).

```sh
npm install react-svg-bubble-slider
```

You'll then need to locate your "posts" layout. In a Gatsby project this is typically saved in `src/layouts/post-layout`, but in short you'll need to import `SvgBubbleSlider` to the template or layout responsible for handling your posts.

Once you've decided which layout you'll be amending, import `SvgBubbleSlider` and add it to the componentâ€™s returned JSX.

```javascript
// post-layout.js
import React from "react"
import { SvgBubbleSlider } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"

const PostLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SvgBubbleSlider />
    </div>
  )
}

export default PostLayout
```

By default `SvgBubbleSlider` displays 14 reactions. This is because I wanted to honor Chris Gannon's original [SVG Bubble Slider](https://codepen.io/chrisgannon/pen/GZNgLw/), but in reality you'll want to use a restricted set of reactions.

To modify the icons your implementation of `SvgBubbleSlider` displays you can use the `icons` prop and pass in only the icons you wish to use.

Here's an example:

```javascript
// post-layout.js
import React from "react"
import { SvgBubbleSlider } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"

const ICONS_TO_USE = ["angry", "sad", "neutral", "smile", "happy", "cool"]

const PostLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SvgBubbleSlider icons={ICONS_TO_USE} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default PostLayout
```

There are a couple caveats when using the `icons` prop:

1. You'll need at least three icons. This is to ensure there are icons to "slide" to and from.
2. The icon names must be from the 14 icons included in the package. Check the [docs](https://react-svg-bubble-slider.netlify.app/?path=/docs/icons--page) for available icon names.

Now that you've got the icons configured, you'll need to get the current reaction, show the reader the current reaction, and then provide a way for the reader to post the current reaction to your back-end of choice.

You can access the current [reaction](https://react-svg-bubble-slider.netlify.app/?path=/docs/svgbubbleslider--reaction) via a render prop which you can pass on to a button.

```diff
// post-layout.js
import React from 'react'
import { SvgBubbleSlider } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"

const ICONS_TO_USE = ["angry", "sad", "neutral", "smile", "happy", "cool"]

const PostLayout = () => {

  return (
    <div>
-     <SvgBubbleSlider icons={ICONS_TO_USE} />
+     <SvgBubbleSlider icons={ICONS_TO_USE}>
+        {({ reaction }) => (
+          <div
+            style={{
+              display: "flex",
+              justifyContent: "center",
+              margin: "24px 0px",
+            }}
+          >
+            <button onClick={() => console.log(reaction)}>
+              {reaction ? reaction : "?"}
+            </button>
+          </div>
+        )}
+     </SvgBubbleSlider>
    </div>
  )
}

export default PostLayout
```

Now that you have a method to access the current reaction you can do something useful with it. In this example i'll show you how to increment the count of a reaction each time it has been selected and the button has been clicked and store it in React's local state.

In reality you'll need to store this data in your back-end of choice but to get you started this will at least show how the React side of things could work.

First import `useState` so you can store the count value in Reacts local state, then you'll need to set an initial shape of the data along with a initial value for the counts

```diff
// post-layout.js
- import React from 'react'
+ import React { useState } from 'react'
 import { SvgBubbleSlider } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"

const ICONS_TO_USE = ["angry", "sad", "neutral", "smile", "happy", "cool"]

const PostLayout = () => {

+   const [stateReactions, setStateReactions] = useState(
+     ICONS_TO_USE.map((name) => {
+       return {
+         name: name,
+         count: 0,
+       }
+     })
+   )

  return (
    <div>
     <SvgBubbleSlider icons={ICONS_TO_USE}>
        {({ reaction }) => (
          <div
            style={{
              display: "flex",
              justifyContent: "center",
              margin: "24px 0px",
            }}
          >
            <button onClick={() => console.log(reaction)}>
              {reaction ? reaction : "?"}
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
     </SvgBubbleSlider>
    </div>
  )
}

export default PostLayout
```

If you pop in a `console.log(stateReactions)` you should see an array of objects like the below:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
[
  {
    name: "angry",
    count: 0,
  },
  {
    name: "sad",
    count: 0,
  },
  {
    name: "neutral",
    count: 0,
  },
  {
    name: "smile",
    count: 0,
  },
  {
    name: "happy",
    count: 0,
  },
  {
    name: "cool",
    count: 0,
  },
]
```

We're now going to surface the icons and their corresponding counts by mapping over the array shown above and returning an `SvgIcon` and it's count value

```diff
// post-layout.js
 import React { useState } from 'react'
- import { SvgBubbleSlider } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"
+ import { SvgBubbleSlider, SvgIcon } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"

const ICONS_TO_USE = ["angry", "sad", "neutral", "smile", "happy", "cool"]

const PostLayout = () => {

   const [stateReactions, setStateReactions] = useState(
     ICONS_TO_USE.map((name) => {
       return {
         name: name,
         count: 0,
       }
     })
   )

  return (
    <div>
     <SvgBubbleSlider icons={ICONS_TO_USE}>
        {({ reaction }) => (
          <div
            style={{
              display: "flex",
              justifyContent: "center",
              margin: "24px 0px",
            }}
          >
            <button onClick={() => console.log(reaction)}>
              {reaction ? reaction : "?"}
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
     </SvgBubbleSlider>
+      <div
+        style={{
+          display: "grid",
+          gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(6, 48px)",
+          justifyContent: "center",
+        }}
+      >
+        {stateReactions.map((reaction, index) => {
+          const { name, count } = reaction
+          return (
+            <div
+              key={index}
+              style={{
+                alignItems: "center",
+                display: "flex",
+                flexDirection: "column",
+              }}
+            >
+              <SvgIcon name={name} />
+              <div>{count}</div>
+            </div>
+          )
+        })}
+     </div>
   </div>
  )
}

export default PostLayout
```

The last step is to handle the user interaction when the button is clicked.

For this you'll need to pass the current reaction name to a function and then update it's count value in local state.

Inside the `handleReaction` you'll map over the current state values and on each iteration check if the reaction name matches the `currentReaction`. If it is then increment the count value, if it's not just return the reaction object un-touched.

This this operation updates state using `setStateReactions` and each time an update occurs the JSX will re-render so you should see the increased count value appear under the corresponding `SvgIcon`

```diff
// post-layout.js
import React { useState } from 'react'
import { SvgBubbleSlider, SvgIcon } from "react-svg-bubble-slider"

const ICONS_TO_USE = ["angry", "sad", "neutral", "smile", "happy", "cool"]

const PostLayout = () => {

   const [stateReactions, setStateReactions] = useState(
     ICONS_TO_USE.map((name) => {
       return {
         name: name,
         count: 0,
       }
     })
   )

+  const handleReaction = (currentReaction) => {
+    setStateReactions(
+      stateReactions.map((reaction) =>
+        reaction.name === currentReaction
+          ? {
+              ...reaction,
+              count: (reaction.count += 1),
+            }
+          : reaction
+      )
+    )
+  }

  return (
    <div>
     <SvgBubbleSlider icons={ICONS_TO_USE}>
        {({ reaction }) => (
          <div
            style={{
              display: "flex",
              justifyContent: "center",
              margin: "24px 0px",
            }}
          >
-           <button onClick={() => console.log(reaction)}>
+           <button onClick={() => handleReaction(reaction)}
              {reaction ? reaction : "?"}
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
     </SvgBubbleSlider>
      <div
        style={{
          display: "grid",
          gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(6, 48px)",
          justifyContent: "center",
        }}
      >
        {stateReactions.map((reaction, index) => {
          const { name, count } = reaction
          return (
            <div
              key={index}
              style={{
                alignItems: "center",
                display: "flex",
                flexDirection: "column",
              }}
            >
              <SvgIcon name={name} />
              <div>{count}</div>
            </div>
          )
        })}
     </div>
   </div>
  )
}

export default PostLayout
```

As mentioned above this example only stores the count values in local state and if you refresh your browser all values are reset. In a real example these count values will need to be stored in a database.

In the [demo application](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/netlify-reactions) i've used FaunaDB and [Chris Biscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi) has an excellent guide called [The Complete Guide to FaunaDB](https://egghead.io/playlists/the-complete-guide-to-faunadb-74bef44b) on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) which walks through the bits you'll need to get started with FaunaDB.
