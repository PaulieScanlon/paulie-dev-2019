Ahoy [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) fans, I hope you're well. This post is to announce that my semi popular Open-source project [gatsby-mdx-embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed) has been officially archived.

But, good news!

I'd also like to announce that [myself](https://twitter.com/PaulieScanlon), [Scott Spence](https://twitter.com/spences10) and [Rich Haines](https://twitter.com/studio_hungry) have been busy migrating it to a new home...

- Docs site: [https://mdx-embed.com](https://mdx-embed.com)
- Repo: [PaulieScanlon/mdx-embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embed)

Thanks to [Griko Nibras](https://twitter.com/griko_nibras) for the snazzy new logo!

The new project is a mono repp setup which is comprised of two main packages:

- The core package [mdx-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-embed)
- The Gatsby specific plugin [gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed)

The new goal for [MDX Embed](https://mdx-embed.com) is for it to work _anywhere_ MDX works!

This actually was always the case except I didn't really call it out in the README but after two fantastic talks by [Monica Powell](https://twitter.com/waterproofheart) and [Kathleen McMahon](https://twitter.com/resource11) at the first ever [MDX Conf](https://mdxjs.com/conf/) it became clear that the name was a little misleading and in fact it could work just as well outside of a Gatsby project.

This was the driving force behind the migration and we hope the new package is every bit as good as the old package.

If you were using the old package `@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed` you'll find information about how to migrate to the new package on the [docs site](https://www.mdx-embed.com/?path=/docs/gatsby-plugin--page) and if you've never heard of MDX Embed before then allow me to explain.

[MDX Embed](https://mdx-embed.com) allows you to quickly and easily embed 3rd party media content such as YouTube Videos, Tweets, Instagram posts and many more directly into your MDX - **no import required!**

The old package as the name suggests was primarily focussed on providing a easy way to embed 3rd part content in Gatsby projects that used MDX for content authoring. Under the hood the Gatsby plugin wrapped Gatsby's "Root Element" in the `MDXEmbedProvider`. This in itself wraps an `MDXProvider` which is where the magic happens.

A typical scenario might be to write about a CodePen you've created, and then using MDX Embed, et voilÃ  you could embed said CodePen right next to your content.

```javascript
// some-post.mdx

# This is some-post.mdx and here\'s a CodePen ðŸ‘‡

 <CodePen codePenId="PNaGbb" />
```

The new package(s) expose the same functionality but if you'd like to use the `MDXEmbedProvider` outside of a Gatsby project you only need install `mdx-embed` It's then over to you to wrap you sites/app/blog root element with it and again et voilÃ  embedded 3rd party media content.

We are working on some [examples](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embed/tree/main/examples) which we hope will help you understand how to use either of the packages and if you have a demo app using the package and wish to add it to our examples, please do!

The old package managed to muster up an impressive 102 starts on GitHub and we'd really like your help in getting the new package but up there and with Re-Tweets of this post we hope to reach all our existing users to inform them of the change.

Happy embedding!

Paul, Scott and Rich
