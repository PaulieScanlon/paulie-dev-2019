import {
  Checkout,
  MatterStepOne,
  MatterStepTwo,
  MatterStepThree,
} from "./matter-js-demo"

Recently I was creating a Shopify demo application and became a little underwhelmed with the Checkout experience and so decided to inject a bit of "joy" into an otherwise quite dull UI component... it was my demo so why not ay? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My plan was to add a "particle" every time the quantity of a product in the _Order_ changed. I wanted this particle to have real world physics and I wanted each particle to have collision detection so that it would bounce off other particles.

Quite a few years ago I used a physics engined called [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) but matter.js pre-dates React so I was curious to see if I could create the same cool physics based _animations_ in React.

Here's what I came up with, have a play around with the `Qty` input.

If you'd like to start using [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) in your project I hope this will give you some indication of how to install it, use it, and the bit I really struggled with, how to make the "canvas" and "floor" responsive.

Start by installing [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)

```sh
npm install matter-js --save
```

Next create a component where you'll do all the "matter" setup, and here's an absolute minimal setup that will get you started. The src file for `MatterStepOne.js` can be found [here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/blob/master/src/posts/2020/08/matter-js-demo/MatterStepOne.js)

## Step One - Setup

```javascript
// MatterStepOne.js
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react"
import Matter from "matter-js"

export const MatterStepOne = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef(null)
  const canvasRef = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    let Engine = Matter.Engine
    let Render = Matter.Render
    let World = Matter.World
    let Bodies = Matter.Bodies

    let engine = Engine.create({})

    let render = Render.create({
      element: boxRef.current,
      engine: engine,
      canvas: canvasRef.current,
      options: {
        width: 300,
        height: 300,
        background: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)",
        wireframes: false,
      },
    })

    const floor = Bodies.rectangle(150, 300, 300, 20, {
      isStatic: true,
      render: {
        fillStyle: "blue",
      },
    })

    const ball = Bodies.circle(150, 0, 10, {
      restitution: 0.9,
      render: {
        fillStyle: "yellow",
      },
    })

    World.add(engine.world, [floor, ball])

    Engine.run(engine)
    Render.run(render)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div
      ref={boxRef}
      style={{
        width: 300,
        height: 300,
      }}
    >
      <canvas ref={canvasRef} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Which should render something like this üëá

<MatterStepOne />

<Divider />

There's a couple of things going on here so I'll talk you through some React specific methods that we need to use.

### useRef

`useRef` is used twice here, first to get a ref to the containing div, `boxRef` and then again on the canvas, `canvasRef`. These are so we can tell matter.js which element to render the canvas in and which canvas we'd like to render the matter.js _engine_ and _world_ in. You'll see both of those refs used in the `Render.create({})` method.

### useEffect

As you may know using `useEffect` with an empty dependencies array means the code will only run once and only run when the component has mounted. It's in here where you can set up the matter.js `Engine`, `Render`, `World` and `Bodies`

## Step Two - Responsive

I had a long hard look around the internet and couldn't really find anything that helped me out here so I've come up with my own solution.

The first thing to get your head around is the difference between...

```html
<canvas ref="{canvasRef}" />
```

and

```javascript
let render = Render.create({
    ...
    canvas: canvasRef.current,
    options: {
    width: 300,
    height: 300,
    ...
    },
})
```

We could use `CSS` to make the `canvas` and containing `div` fill `100%` or to put it another way, make them responsive, but... matter.js would still think the canvas has a `width` and `height` of `300`

To make the canvas truly responsive we need to do update matter.js with some new values which will be used as the `width` and `height`. In addition to this the position and width of the floor also need to be updated.

To achieve this I've added a `resize` listener to the `window`

When the `window` is resized `handleResize()` is called which uses `getBoundingClientRect()` to get the `width` and `height` of the `boxRef`.

These values are then used to update the state value `constraints` which will cause a re-render then we can grab these new `width` and `height` values in a second `useEffect` which is triggered only when the new constraint values are set and use them to dynamically update both the floor and the canvas

The src file for `MatterStepTwo.js` can be found [here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/blob/master/src/posts/2020/08/matter-js-demo/MatterStepTwo.js)

```javascript
//MatterStepTwo.js
import React, { useEffect, useState, useRef } from "react"
import Matter from "matter-js"

const STATIC_DENSITY = 15

export const MatterStepTwo = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef(null)
  const canvasRef = useRef(null)

  const [constraints, setContraints] = useState()
  const [scene, setScene] = useState()

  const handleResize = () => {
    setContraints(boxRef.current.getBoundingClientRect())
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    let Engine = Matter.Engine
    let Render = Matter.Render
    let World = Matter.World
    let Bodies = Matter.Bodies

    let engine = Engine.create({})

    let render = Render.create({
      element: boxRef.current,
      engine: engine,
      canvas: canvasRef.current,
      options: {
        background: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)",
        wireframes: false,
      },
    })

    const floor = Bodies.rectangle(0, 0, 0, STATIC_DENSITY, {
      isStatic: true,
      render: {
        fillStyle: "blue",
      },
    })

    const ball = Bodies.circle(150, 0, 10, {
      restitution: 0.9,
      render: {
        fillStyle: "yellow",
      },
    })

    World.add(engine.world, [floor, ball])

    Engine.run(engine)
    Render.run(render)

    setContraints(boxRef.current.getBoundingClientRect())
    setScene(render)

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize)
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize)
    }
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    if (constraints) {
      let { width, height } = constraints

      // Dynamically update canvas and bounds
      scene.bounds.max.x = width
      scene.bounds.max.y = height
      scene.options.width = width
      scene.options.height = height
      scene.canvas.width = width
      scene.canvas.height = height

      // Dynamically update floor
      const floor = scene.engine.world.bodies[0]

      Matter.Body.setPosition(floor, {
        x: width / 2,
        y: height + STATIC_DENSITY / 2,
      })

      Matter.Body.setVertices(floor, [
        { x: 0, y: height },
        { x: width, y: height },
        { x: width, y: height + STATIC_DENSITY },
        { x: 0, y: height + STATIC_DENSITY },
      ])
    }
  }, [scene, constraints])

  return (
    <div
      style={{ position: "relative", border: "1px solid blue", padding: "8px" }}
    >
      <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Checkout</div>
      <div
        style={{
          display: "grid",
          gridTemplateColumns: "1fr auto",
          rowGap: "16px",
          marginBottom: "32px",
        }}
      >
        <div>SubTitle</div>
        <div>¬£xxx</div>
        <div>Discount</div>
        <div>¬£xxx</div>
        <div>Total</div>
        <div>¬£xxx</div>
      </div>

      <button
        style={{
          cursor: "pointer",
          display: "block",
          textAlign: "center",
          marginBottom: "16px",
          width: "100%",
        }}
      >
        Checkout
      </button>

      <div
        ref={boxRef}
        style={{
          position: "absolute",
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
        }}
      >
        <canvas ref={canvasRef} />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Which should render something like this üëá

<MatterStepTwo />

<Divider />

## Step Three - Triggers

The final step is to trigger a re-render when an interaction happens. In the top example this is when the value of the inputs change but in this step I'll show how to do it from an `onClick` on the button. (it's just easier to explain)

The src file for `MatterStepThree.js` can be found [here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/blob/master/src/posts/2020/08/matter-js-demo/MatterStepThree.js)

```javascript
// MatterStepThree.js

import React, { useEffect, useState, useRef } from "react"
import Matter from "matter-js"

const STATIC_DENSITY = 15
const PARTICLE_SIZE = 6
const PARTICLE_BOUNCYNESS = 0.9

export const MatterStepThree = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef(null)
  const canvasRef = useRef(null)

  const [constraints, setContraints] = useState()
  const [scene, setScene] = useState()

  const [someStateValue, setSomeStateValue] = useState(false)

  const handleResize = () => {
    setContraints(boxRef.current.getBoundingClientRect())
  }

  const handleClick = () => {
    setSomeStateValue(!someStateValue)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    let Engine = Matter.Engine
    let Render = Matter.Render
    let World = Matter.World
    let Bodies = Matter.Bodies

    let engine = Engine.create({})

    let render = Render.create({
      element: boxRef.current,
      engine: engine,
      canvas: canvasRef.current,
      options: {
        background: "transparent",
        wireframes: false,
      },
    })

    const floor = Bodies.rectangle(0, 0, 0, STATIC_DENSITY, {
      isStatic: true,
      render: {
        fillStyle: "blue",
      },
    })

    World.add(engine.world, [floor])

    Engine.run(engine)
    Render.run(render)

    setContraints(boxRef.current.getBoundingClientRect())
    setScene(render)

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize)
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize)
    }
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    if (constraints) {
      let { width, height } = constraints

      // Dynamically update canvas and bounds
      scene.bounds.max.x = width
      scene.bounds.max.y = height
      scene.options.width = width
      scene.options.height = height
      scene.canvas.width = width
      scene.canvas.height = height

      // Dynamically update floor
      const floor = scene.engine.world.bodies[0]

      Matter.Body.setPosition(floor, {
        x: width / 2,
        y: height + STATIC_DENSITY / 2,
      })

      Matter.Body.setVertices(floor, [
        { x: 0, y: height },
        { x: width, y: height },
        { x: width, y: height + STATIC_DENSITY },
        { x: 0, y: height + STATIC_DENSITY },
      ])
    }
  }, [scene, constraints])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Add a new "ball" everytime `someStateValue` changes
    if (scene) {
      let { width } = constraints
      let randomX = Math.floor(Math.random() * -width) + width
      Matter.World.add(
        scene.engine.world,
        Matter.Bodies.circle(randomX, -PARTICLE_SIZE, PARTICLE_SIZE, {
          restitution: PARTICLE_BOUNCYNESS,
        })
      )
    }
  }, [someStateValue])

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: "relative",
        border: "1px solid white",
        padding: "8px",
      }}
    >
      <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Checkout</div>
      <div
        style={{
          display: "grid",
          gridTemplateColumns: "1fr auto",
          rowGap: "16px",
          marginBottom: "32px",
        }}
      >
        <div>SubTitle</div>
        <div>¬£xxx</div>
        <div>Discount</div>
        <div>¬£xxx</div>
        <div>Total</div>
        <div>¬£xxx</div>
      </div>

      <button
        style={{
          cursor: "pointer",
          display: "block",
          textAlign: "center",
          marginBottom: "16px",
          width: "100%",
        }}
        onClick={() => handleClick()}
      >
        Checkout
      </button>

      <div
        ref={boxRef}
        style={{
          position: "absolute",
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
          pointerEvents: "none",
        }}
      >
        <canvas ref={canvasRef} />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Which should render something like this üëá, go ahead and click the "Checkout" button

<MatterStepThree />

The main takeout from this is that to add a new ball I've added another `useEffect` that is triggered when `someStateValue` changes. The code in this `useEffect` adds a new ball at a `randomX` position between 0 and what ever the current `width` is set to. In this example it's the `onClick` that changes the `someStateValue` but in the top example that `useEffect` is triggered whenever the quantities change and is fired by the inputs not the Checkout button... apologies if that's a little confusing!
