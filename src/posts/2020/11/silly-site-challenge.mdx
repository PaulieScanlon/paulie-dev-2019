## [Go Go Go](#go-go-go)

I'm at it again ðŸ•º

If you followed along when I did my [100 Days Of Gatsby](/posts/2020/01/100DaysOfGatsby/) you'll know I have a tendency to write way too much about very little ðŸ˜¥

... but because [100 Days Of Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days/) was an absolute tray of cakes I'm super excited to be doing it again for the recently announced [Silly Site Challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/silly-site-challenge/)

If you'd like to know more about the challenge hosted by Gatsby have a read [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/silly-site-challenge/) and be sure to follow [GatsbyJS](https://twitter.com/GatsbyJS) on Twitter or search for the hashtag [#SillySiteChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SillySiteChallenge?src=hashtag_click)

This time round I'll be doing things a little differently because updating a blog post every day for 100 days was, as you'd imagine... an absolute ball ache!

Instead i'll update less frequently but with more significant information... deal?

Great... see you around!
