import { MrStyled } from './MrStyled'

In my last post I attempted to explain [Theme UI's Jsx Pragma](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-1/) in this post i'll be
breaking down how to use Theme UI's [Styled component](https://theme-ui.com/styled)

The Styled component introduces a new concept, it's related to the previous post by way of CSS properties being mapped
to theme object keys but this time we'll be mapping HTML dom elements to theme object keys.

This is particularly helpful to understand if you're looking to style HTML elements from Jsx components and HTML
elements that may be passed from markdown, `.md` or MDX, `.mdx`

The key to understanding the Styled component is to understand how Theme UI maps HTML dom types to it's `styles` theme
object key. Feel free to bookmark the [styles](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#styles) spec as i'll be referring to it
frequently

To help demonstrate how the styles work we're going to build a very _simple_ component which you can see below, i've
called it `<MrStyled />` and you can find the `src`
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrStyled.js)

## [styles](#styles)

The core principle here is understanding the relationship between HTML dom elements and where in the theme object Theme
UI looks to find the styles.

As a practical example go ahead and create a `<MrStyled />` component and ensure you can render it to a page as we'll
need to see the output. _it's worth noting the styles you see here in this post are mapped to the styles I already use
around my blog, moreover, my blog is based on my theme:
[gatsby-theme-terminal](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-theme-terminal)_

<Divider />

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Styled } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrStyled = () => {
  return <Styled.h3>MrStyled</Styled.h3>
}
```

<Divider />

If you inspect "MrStyled" in your browser you should be able to see that the render output of `<MrStyled />` is in fact
a standard HTML `<h3>` element and will most likely have a weird `class` name, e.g ".css-1cl1f0n". Class names are
automatically generated by Theme UI but you can if you need an escape hatch add your own, although _I advise you don't_

If you inspect `<MrStyled />` from this the below you should see it has similar styles applied as per below

<Grid 
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}
>

<Box>

Component ðŸ‘‡

<MrStyled />

</Box>

<Box>

CSS ðŸ‘‡

```css
font-family: Inconsolata, monospace;
font-weight: 700;
font-size: 18px;
margin-top: 0;
margin-bottom: 16px;
color: var(--theme-ui-colors-secondary, #c39eff);
```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

I'd like to draw you attention if I may to the absence of the `class` name where I've defined `<Styled.h3 />` which begs
the question where the W.T.Flip are the styles being applied.

The secret lies in the theme object. You'll notice from the below there's an object called `styles` within `styles`
there's an object called `h3` and within the `h3` object are the styles that Theme UI applies to `<Styled.h3 />` because
it's being mapped by default to `theme.styles.h3`

<Divider />

```javascript
// theme.js

export default {
  colors: {
    secondary: '#c39eff',
  },
  fonts: {
    heading: 'Inconsolata, monospace',
  },
  fontWeights: {
    heading: 700,
  },
  styles: {
    h3: {
      fontFamily: 'heading',
      fontWeight: 'heading',
      fontSize: '18px',
      marginTop: 0,
      marginBottom: 16,
      color: 'secondary',
    },
  },
}
```

<Divider />

There's a few other things going on in `theme.styles.h3` which i'll attempt to explain now. You may or may not know but
in Object Oriented JavaScript it's not possible for an object key to reference itself of a parent object.

Using the above as an example the `fontFamily` value is "heading", heading is a "string" which in normal OOP wouldn't
mean anything but Theme UI is able to map "strings" to values contained elsewhere in the theme object.

In the case of `fontFamily` Theme UI maps the "heading" string to `theme.styles.font.heading` which has a value of
"Inconsolata, monospace". Theme UI uses the same approach for `fontWeight` which maps to `theme.fontsWeights.heading`,
similarly `color` is mapped to `theme.colors.secondary`.

Understanding where Theme UI maps HTML element types and CSS properties to is a fundamental requirement if you're
planning on using Theme UI to style your project. Take some time to familiarize yourself with both the
[Styles](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#styles) and the [Theme Scales](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec#theme-scales)
