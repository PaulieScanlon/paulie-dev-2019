After a recent Twitter conversation with my good chum [Scott](https://twitter.com/spences10) we decided we'd both write a post about the various ways Serverless Functions could be used to render GitHub repository language data in our respective Gatsby Blogs

After a bit of initial brainstorming we both had a few extra requirements for the outcome of this experiment.

Scott wanted a re-usable endpoint that will return a chart as an image

And I wanted to investigate ways to render an Svg chart both with and without the use of client side JavaScript.

Scott was starting to look at the GraphQL GitHub API and i've recently completed a ton of work with the GitHub REST api on my [Silly Site Challenge](/posts/2020/11/silly-site-challenge/)

Apologies in advance for the rather long-winded blog title but as it suggests in this post i'm going to explain how you can use [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) and the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest) to create Data Visualizations in your Gatsby blog.

A pre-cursor to this post is that [Scott](https://twitter.com/spences10) and I have teamed up to make a kind of "duo-post" approach. We'll both be attempting to create the same thing but will both be using very different approaches
