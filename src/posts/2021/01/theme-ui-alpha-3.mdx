import { MrJsxCard } from './MrJsxCard'
import { MrStyledCard } from './MrStyledCard'
import { MrComponentCard } from './MrComponentCard'

In this post i'm going to explain how to use Theme UI's _built in_ components. If you're new to Theme UI i'd suggest
having a read of the first two posts in this series to bring you up to speed

- 1. [Understanding Theme UI: 1 - Jsx Pragma](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-1/)
- 2. [Understanding Theme UI: 2 - Styled component](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-2/)

If you have read the first two posts, I must apologize as I'll now be explaining why I don't use either of those methods
but I will of course be offering up an my preferred approach.

Under the hood things remain broadly the same, it's where we write the Jsx that differs somewhat. To give you a taster
of what I'll be covering I have previously touched upon this subject in a previous post:
[Everything's a box](/posts/2021/07/everythings-a-box/)

To demonstrate I'll be creating the same component using three different methods available to you in Theme UI and
explain why I prefer the final method which i'll refer to as "the component" approach"

### The Jsx approach

This approach uses the Jsx Pragma and is mostly what you'll see in the docs. You can find the `src` for this component
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrJsxCard.js)

<Grid
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}
>

<Box>

<MrJsxCard />

```javascript
// MrJsxCard.js

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrJsxCard = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        backgroundColor: 'surface',
      }}
    >
      <img
        src="https://placedog.net/600/350"
        alt="a dog - woof"
        sx={{ boxSizing: 'border-box', margin: 0, minWidth: 0, maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
      <div
        sx={{
          p: 3,
        }}
      >
        <h4
          sx={{
            color: 'text',
            fontFamily: 'heading',
            fontWeight: 'heading',
            fontSize: 2,
            mt: 0,
            mb: 3,
          }}
        >
          MrJsxCard
        </h4>
        <p
          sx={{
            color: 'text',
            fontFamily: 'body',
            fontWeight: 'body',
            mt: 0,
            mb: 3,
          }}
        >
          Lorem ipsum ...
        </p>
        <button
          sx={{
            appearance: 'none',
            backgroundColor: 'primary',
            border: 0,
            color: 'text',
            borderRadius: 0,
            cursor: 'pointer',
            fontSize: 1,
            lineHeight: 'inherit',
            minWidth: 120,
            margin: 0,
            textDecoration: 'none',
            px: 3,
            py: 2,
            ':focus': {
              outline: 'none',
              transition: '.2s linear box-shadow',
              boxShadow: (theme) => `0 0 0 2px ${theme.colors.muted}`,
            },
          }}
        >
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

Pretty verbose ay?! That's because there's quite a lot of styles applied via the `sx` prop. Each mapped CSS property
still looks to the correct part of the theme to find it's appropriate value but this approach can lead to duplicating a
lot of styles between components making re-usability difficult to maintain.

### The Styled approach

This approach uses the Styled component which can reduce the verbosity. You can find the `src` for this component
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrStyledCard.js)

<Grid
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}

<Box>

<MrStyledCard />

</Box>

```javascript
// MrStyledCard.js

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, Styled } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrStyledCard = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        backgroundColor: 'surface',
      }}
    >
      <Styled.img
        src="https://placedog.net/600/350"
        alt="a dog - woof"
        sx={{ boxSizing: 'border-box', margin: 0, minWidth: 0, maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
      <div
        sx={{
          p: 3,
        }}
      >
        <Styled.h4>MrStyledCard</Styled.h4>
        <Styled.p>Lorem ipsum ...</Styled.p>
        <button
          sx={{
            appearance: 'none',
            backgroundColor: 'primary',
            border: 0,
            color: 'text',
            borderRadius: 0,
            cursor: 'pointer',
            fontSize: 1,
            lineHeight: 'inherit',
            minWidth: 120,
            margin: 0,
            textDecoration: 'none',
            px: 3,
            py: 2,
            ':focus': {
              outline: 'none',
              transition: '.2s linear box-shadow',
              boxShadow: (theme) => `0 0 0 2px ${theme.colors.muted}`,
            },
          }}
        >
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

By using `<Styled.h4 />` and `<Styled.p />` we can remove quite a few styles from the `<h4 />` and `<p />` HTML
elements. This is a perfectly valid way to use Theme UI but personally the _mix n match_ methods of using the Jsx Pragma
and Styled don't quite sit right with me. The `<button />` is still a little verbose looking and would be tricky to
re-use

### The Component approach

This approach (my preference) uses Theme UI's built in components. As with CSS properties, components can also "map" to
a specific objects within the theme. You can find the `src` for this component
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrComponentCard.js)

<Grid
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}
>

<Box>

Output ðŸ‘‡

<MrComponentCard />

</Box>

<Box>

Src ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// MrComponentCard.js

import React from 'react'
import { Box, Heading, Text, Button, Card, Image } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrComponentCard = () => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Image src="https://placedog.net/600/350" alt="a dog - woof" />
      <Box
        sx={{
          p: 3,
        }}
      >
        <Heading as="h4" variant="styles.h4">
          MrComponentCard
        </Heading>
        <Text as="p" variant="styles.p">
          Lorem ipsum ...
        </Text>
        <Button>Click Me</Button>
      </Box>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

Using Theme UI's components keeps things consistent and we no longer need to _mix n match_ methods and, et voilÃ  the
React import is back which makes this component look much more familiar. I also believe this is much more readable in
terms of what each component is, e.g "Heading" and "Text" and because all components are mapped back to the theme we can
_hide_ all their styles away in the theme object.

Only one element has an `sx` prop, the `<Box />` personally I feel it's ok to add the `sx` props on layout _wrappers_
for CSS properties like `padding`, `margin` and `display` etc as these vary greatly from component to component. The
styles for common or re-usable components e.g `<Heading />`, `<Text />` and `<Button />` have all been neatly abstracted
away.

I've mentioned "mapping" a few times throughout these posts and I know from discussions this is a tricky concept to
grasp, but, it **is** covered in the docs if you know where to look.

Here's what the [docs](https://theme-ui.com/components/button) say about the `<Button />` component

<Divider />

> Button variants can be defined in the `theme.buttons` object. The Button component uses `theme.buttons.primary` as its
> default variant style.

<Divider />

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  colors: {
   ...
  },
  fonts: {
   ...
  },
  fontWeights: {
   ...
  },
  space : {
   ...
  },
  styles: {
   ...
  },
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      backgroundColor: 'primary',
      color: 'text',
      ...
      ':focus' : {
        ...
      }
    },
  },
}
```

<Divider />

Hopefully you can see the theme object above contains an object called `buttons` and within it is another object called
`primary`. This is the location in the theme object that the `<Button />` component will look to by default for it's
styles.

If you wanted to introduce a new variant, e.g "secondary" you could do the following

<Grid
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}
>

<Box>

Usage ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<Button variant="secondary">Click Me</Button>
```

Output ðŸ‘‡

<Button variant="secondary">Click Me</Button>

</Box>

<Box>

Theme ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// path-to-theme/index.js

export default {
  ...
  buttons: {
    primary: {
     ...
    },
    secondary : {
      backgroundColor: 'secondary',
      color: 'background',
      ...
      ':focus' : {
        ...
      }
    }
  },
}

```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

In this scenario instead of the `<Button />` defaulting to `theme.buttons.primary` we re-map it to
`theme.buttons.secondary` by applying a variant prop of "secondary"

The above introduces a new concept called "variants" and variants can be used by components using the `variant` prop or
by using `variant` as CSS key from either the `sx` prop or from within the theme object itself. I'll be discussing
variants in more depth in a later post so please hang tight whilst I whip up more code snippets and examples.
