import { MrJsxCard } from './MrJsxCard'
import { MrStyledCard } from './MrStyledCard'
import { MrComponentCard } from './MrComponentCard'

In this post i'm going to explain how to use Theme UI's _built in_ components. If you're new to Theme UI i'd suggest
having a read of the first two posts in this series to bring you up to speed

- 1. [Theme UI's Jsx Pragma](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-1/)
- 2. [Theme UI's Styled component](/posts/2021/01/theme-ui-alpha-2/)

If you have read the first two posts, I must apologize as I'll now be explaining why I don't use either of them but I
will instead be offering up an alternative approach.

Under the hood things remain broadly the same, it's where we write the Jsx that differs somewhat. To give you taster of
what I'll be covering I have previously touched on this topic in this post:
[Everything's a box](/posts/2021/07/everythings-a-box/)

I'll start by creating simple component using the three main methods available to you in Theme UI and explain why I
prefer the "component" approach.

### MrJsxCard

This approach uses the Jsx Pragma and is mostly what you'll see in the docs. You can find the `src`
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrJsxCard.js)

<Grid
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}
>

<Box>

Output ðŸ‘‡

<MrJsxCard />

</Box>

```javascript
// MrJsxCard.js

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrJsxCard = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        backgroundColor: 'surface',
      }}
    >
      <img
        src="https://placedog.net/600/350"
        alt="a dog - woof"
        sx={{ boxSizing: 'border-box', margin: 0, minWidth: 0, maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
      <div
        sx={{
          p: 3,
        }}
      >
        <h4
          sx={{
            color: 'text',
            fontFamily: 'heading',
            fontWeight: 'heading',
            fontSize: 2,
            mt: 0,
            mb: 3,
          }}
        >
          MrJsxCard
        </h4>
        <p
          sx={{
            color: 'text',
            fontFamily: 'body',
            fontWeight: 'body',
            mt: 0,
            mb: 3,
          }}
        >
          Lorem ipsum ...
        </p>
        <button
          sx={{
            appearance: 'none',
            backgroundColor: 'primary',
            border: 0,
            color: 'text',
            borderRadius: 0,
            cursor: 'pointer',
            fontSize: 1,
            lineHeight: 'inherit',
            minWidth: 120,
            margin: 0,
            textDecoration: 'none',
            px: 3,
            py: 2,
            ':focus': {
              outline: 'none',
              transition: '.2s linear box-shadow',
              boxShadow: (theme) => `0 0 0 2px ${theme.colors.muted}`,
            },
          }}
        >
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

Pretty verbose ay?! That's because there's quite a lot of styles applied via the `sx` prop. Each mapped CSS property
still looks to the correct part of the theme to find it's appropriate value but this approach can lead to duplicating a
lot of styles between components making re-usability difficult to maintain.

### MrStyledCard

This approach uses the Styled component which can reduce the verbosity. You can find the`src`
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrStyledCard.js)

 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}

/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, Styled } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrStyledCard = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        backgroundColor: 'surface',
      }}
    >
      <Styled.img
        src="https://placedog.net/600/350"
        alt="a dog - woof"
        sx={{ boxSizing: 'border-box', margin: 0, minWidth: 0, maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
      />
      <div
        sx={{
          p: 3,
        }}
      >
        <Styled.h4>MrStyledCard</Styled.h4>
        <Styled.p>Lorem ipsum ...</Styled.p>
        <button
          sx={{
            appearance: 'none',
            backgroundColor: 'primary',
            border: 0,
            color: 'text',
            borderRadius: 0,
            cursor: 'pointer',
            fontSize: 1,
            lineHeight: 'inherit',
            minWidth: 120,
            margin: 0,
            textDecoration: 'none',
            px: 3,
            py: 2,
            ':focus': {
              outline: 'none',
              transition: '.2s linear box-shadow',
              boxShadow: (theme) => `0 0 0 2px ${theme.colors.muted}`,
            },
          }}
        >
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Box>

</Grid>

By using `<Styled.h4 />` and `<Styled.p />` we can remove quite a few styles from the `<h4 />` and `<p />` HTML
elements. This is a perfectly valid way to use Theme UI but personally the _mix n match_ methods of using the Jsx Pragma
and Styled don't quite sit right with me. The `<button />` is also a little verbose looking

### MrComponentCard

This approach (my preference) uses Theme UI's built in components. As with CSS properties, components can also "map" to
a specific object within the theme. You can find the`src`
[here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-dev-2019/tree/master/src/posts/2021/01/MrComponentCard.js)

<Grid
 sx={{
  gridTemplateColumns: ["1fr", '1fr 1fr']
 }}
>

<Box>

<MrComponentCard />

</Box>

```javascript
// MrComponentCard.js

import React from 'react'
import { Box, Heading, Text, Button, Card, Image } from 'theme-ui'

export const MrComponentCard = () => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Image src="https://placedog.net/600/350" alt="a dog - woof" />
      <Box
        sx={{
          p: 3,
        }}
      >
        <Heading as="h4" variant="styles.h4">
          MrComponentCard
        </Heading>
        <Text as="p" variant="styles.p">
          Lorem ipsum ...
        </Text>
        <Button>Click Me</Button>
      </Box>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

</Box>

</Grid>

<Divider />

Using Theme UI's components keeps things consistent and we no longer need to _mix n match_ methods and, et voilÃ  the
React import is back which makes this component look much more familiar. I also believe this is much more readable in
terms of what each component is, e.g "Heading" and "Text" and because all components are mapped back to theme we can
_hide_ all their styles away in the theme object.

Only one element has an `sx` prop, the `<Box />` personally I feel it's ok to add the `sx` props on layout _wrappers_
for CSS properties like `padding` or `margin` or perhaps `display` as these vary greatly from component to component.
The styles for common or re-usable components e.g Heading, Text and Button have all been neatly abstracted away.

I've mentioned "mapping" a few times throughout these posts and I know from discussions this is a tricky concept to
grasp, but, it _is_ there in the docs if you know where to look.

Here's what the [docs](https://theme-ui.com/components/button) say about the `<Button />` component

<Divider />

> Button variants can be defined in the theme.buttons object. The Button component uses theme.buttons.primary as its
> default variant style.

<Divider />

```javascript
// theme.js

export default {
  colors: {
   ...
  },
  fonts: {
   ...
  },
  fontWeights: {
   ...
  },
  space : {
   ...
  },
  styles: {
   ...
  },
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      backgroundColor: 'primary',
      borderRadius: '0px',
      color: 'text',
      cursor: 'pointer',
      ...
      ':focus' : {
          ...
      }
    },
  },
}
```

<Divider />

Hopefully you can see the theme snippet above contains an object called `buttons` and within it is another object called
`primary`. This is the part the docs explain that the `<Button />` component will look to by default for it's styles.

The above introduces a new concept called "variants" and I'll be discussing variants in more depth a later post so hang
tight whilst I whip up more code snippets and examples.
