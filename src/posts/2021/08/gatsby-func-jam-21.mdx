Here we go again üï∫

In 2019/2020 I blogged every day for 100 days totaling 27,341 words and you can read them all in this post:
[100 Days Of Gatsby](/posts/2020/01/100DaysOfGatsby/), but if you don't have a million hours to spare Gatsby asked me to
write a round-up post which can be seen on the Gatsby blog:
[Challenge Accepted: One Developer, 10 Projects, 100 Days of Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-04-20-paulie-scanlons-journey-of-100-days)

In 2020 I participated in Gatsby's
[Silly Site Challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/silly-site-challenge#gatsby-skip-here) and developed my site
[BumHub](https://bumhub.netlify.app/) in public. You can read all about that in a blog post I updated as the challenge
progressed: [Silly Site Challenge](/https://paulie.dev/posts/2020/11/silly-site-challenge/)

...and joy of joys I won!

Here's the official announcement:
[Presenting the 2020 Silly Site Challenge Winners!](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-silly-site-top-20/#gatsby-skip-here)

Gatsby again asked if i'd do a little write up, so here ya go:
[Bottoms Up: Gatsby File System Route API + Bums = BumHub](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/bottoms-up-gatsby-file-system-route-api-bums-bumhub)

And as of about 8pm last night (my time) Gatsby announced
[#FuncJam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FuncJam?src=hashtag_click)

<Tweet tweetLink="GatsbyJS/status/1427709225497726982" />

... which may or may not be a name I came up with üòè

<Tweet tweetLink="pauliescanlon/status/1397215365105602562?s=21" />

... but either way. I'm doing it, and not for the super duper prizes but because I love it.

As before with [Silly Site Challenge](/https://paulie.dev/posts/2020/11/silly-site-challenge/) I plan to update this
blog post as and when I make significant progress.

## [Update 1](#update-1)

### Aug 18 2021

Last night and on my lunch break today I've whipped up a new Gatsby site and hosted in on Gatsby Cloud. For now all the
site does is display a 3D Globe which I created using React Three Fibre, you can read about how I did that in this post
published by Smashing Magazine:
[Gatsby Serverless Functions And The International Space Station](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/gatsby-serverless-functions-international-space-station/)

The idea I have at the moment will be to use both the static and the dynamic offerings from Gatsby.

##### Static

The Google Analytics API is rate limited and whilst I could hit the endpoint and request all `pageViews` for the Groovy
Analytics site and plot the lat/lng locations on the 3D Globe using Gatsby Functions, I fear that the rate limits will
soon cap out and the request would fail. Instead, I'll be using the power of Gatsby to hit the Google Analytics API at
build time... It's kinda weird to request data at build time and pump it into a 3D globe because part of the reason
static data is so cool is because it's baked right into the page, meaning your site is blazing fast, SEO friendly and
works with JavaScript disabled in the browser. Sadly no such luck when using this data to drive geographical locations
on a Three.js globe... but, Gatsby if nothing else is totally flexible so why not eh?!

There's a problem though.... This is FuncJam and sourcing data at build time using `gatsby-node` isn't making use of
Gatsby Functions.

##### Dynamic

To take advantage of Gatsby Functions I plan to add a number of other features that won't succumb to rate limiting.
These features may include the following:

- Posting reactions to a backend like Fauna
- Adding Authentication using Auth0 to authenticate users
- Allowing authenticated users to leave comments on the site
- Hitting my own abstracted API: [paulieapi](https://paulieapi.gatsbyjs.io/) to display real time Twitter or GitHub
  information on the site (that API is also built using Gatsby Functions and hosted on Gatsby Cloud FYI)
- A Newsletter sign up form (gotta have a form in there somewhere right!)

... or maybe all of the above.

I'll see how much time I have after working my day job building _complex_ / boring React Applications that no one cares
about.
