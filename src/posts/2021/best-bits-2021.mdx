## 1. Presenting the 2020 Silly Site Challenge Winners!

In Dec 2020 I participated in Gatsby's
[#SillySiteChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SillySiteChallenge?src=hashtag_click&f=live) where I fused creative
web development with next level Gatsby tech to create [BumHub](https://bumhub.netlify.app/). The challenge saw 900
developers from around the globe participate in the challenge with 134 crossing the finish line. The top Twenty entries
were awarded a spot in the hall of fame but, unbelievably I was named **overall winner**. You can read the full post

## 2. Bottoms Up: Gatsby File System Route API + Bums = BumHub

As mentioned above I was announced the **overall winner** of Gatsby's 2020
[#SillySiteChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SillySiteChallenge?src=hashtag_click&f=live) and was asked to write a
rundown of how I came up with the idea and what my working process involves. You can read the full post
