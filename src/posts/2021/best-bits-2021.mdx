Oh hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Here's a byte-size round up of projects I've Open-sourced, posts and articles I've written and contracts I've completed so far this year. This post is pinned and will be updated as the year progresses. For reference here's my [best bits from 2020](/posts/2020/best-bits-2020/)

I recently participated in Gatsby's [#SillySiteChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SillySiteChallenge?src=hashtag_click&f=live) where I fused creative web development with next level Gatsby tech. I'm currently writing up my journey and working process for a featured article that'll be published on the Gatsby blog. I'll circle back here at some point to add the link but in the meantime here's the post I updated throughout the challenge: [silly-site-challenge/#go-go-go](/posts/2020/11/silly-site-challenge/#go-go-go)
