# Paul Scanlon

### Jamstack Developer

Well hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul and a long long time ago I was a designer but after a few years of pixel pushing I realised code is just
better! Iâ€™ve held various positions in and around advertising and web development in both permanent and contract
positions since 2005, and I once co-founded and ran an award winning digital production agency called Super natural
based in London.
